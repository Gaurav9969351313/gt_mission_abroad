Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices. In the villa and townhouse segment, high activity was seen in diverse communities across Dubai, including Mirdif, Damac Hills 2, and Emirates Living. While rental price growth shows signs of stabilising 7%-12% increases were still common in key areas. Notably, some luxury communities outperformed, with average rental prices in Bluewaters (+14.1%), and villa and townhouse rentals in Palm Jumeirah (+17.0%), Dubai Hills Estate (+33.8%), and Arabian Ranches (+20.6%) seeing sharp rises.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Sophia MoessnerSophia Moessner,,"Dubai's expanding population continues to drive strong demand in the rental market. Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices. In the villa and townhouse segment, high activity was seen in diverse communities across Dubai, including Mirdif, Damac Hills 2, and Emirates Living. While rental price growth shows signs of stabilising 7%-12% increases were still common in key areas. Notably, some luxury communities outperformed, with average rental prices in Bluewaters (+14.1%), and villa and townhouse rentals in Palm Jumeirah (+17.0%), Dubai Hills Estate (+33.8%), and Arabian Ranches (+20.6%) seeing sharp rises.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Sophia MoessnerSophia Moessner,,"Dubai's expanding population continues to drive strong demand in the rental market. Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices. In the villa and townhouse segment, high activity was seen in diverse communities across Dubai, including Mirdif, Damac Hills 2, and Emirates Living. While rental price growth shows signs of stabilising 7%-12% increases were still common in key areas. Notably, some luxury communities outperformed, with average rental prices in Bluewaters (+14.1%), and villa and townhouse rentals in Palm Jumeirah (+17.0%), Dubai Hills Estate (+33.8%), and Arabian Ranches (+20.6%) seeing sharp rises.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in. Azizi’s advantage is transit access, community density, and ongoing developments that bring future value.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

ADT was formed as part of the restructuring of the commercial ports sector in the Emirate and is the manager and operator of Khalifa Port Container Terminal (KPCT), the region’s first semi-automated and most technologically advanced terminal which was officially inaugurated on December 12, 2012. ADT's other facilities formerly included Zayed Port, a historical port that has served the capital for over 40 years and Musafah Port, located in the heart of the industrial area. Abu Dhabi Terminals was responsible for the smooth transition of container traffic from the old Zayed Port to the new Khalifa Port, located in Taweelah - midway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.In supervision of P. M. K. Hassan Siddique Sir, in the course of ""Port & Terminal Operation (PML 3103), I have given a poster presentation on a short summary of Abu Dhabi Terminals' (ADT) functions and operations. As I have found, they have focused on more automated port operating system with AI, robotics and distance operating vehicles. Their strategic locaiton also helping them to maximize their profitability. According to their 2030 vision, they will be a diverse port with wider range of cargo handling.hashtag#port_terminal_operationhashtag#ADThashtag#AbuDhabiTerminalshashtag#PortOperators

It’s about distribution thresholds, ownership timing, and diversity of investors. Clear rules. Clearer outcomes.This update isn’t just a technical fix - it’s a reflection of the UAE’s commitment to being both competitive and compliant.

Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices. In the villa and townhouse segment, high activity was seen in diverse communities across Dubai, including Mirdif, Damac Hills 2, and Emirates Living. While rental price growth shows signs of stabilising 7%-12% increases were still common in key areas. Notably, some luxury communities outperformed, with average rental prices in Bluewaters (+14.1%), and villa and townhouse rentals in Palm Jumeirah (+17.0%), Dubai Hills Estate (+33.8%), and Arabian Ranches (+20.6%) seeing sharp rises.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in. Azizi’s advantage is transit access, community density, and ongoing developments that bring future value. Investors who plan for 3-5 years, not 6 months, win in this play.”Final Thought:There’s no right or wrong — just real insights.And there’s always a client for every developer.D&B Properties hashtag#AziziDevelopments hashtag#DubaiInvestmentTips hashtag#RentalOpportunities hashtag#SalesTrainerTips hashtag#MarketTruth

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Clearer outcomes.This update isn’t just a technical fix - it’s a reflection of the UAE’s commitment to being both competitive and compliant.

Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices. In the villa and townhouse segment, high activity was seen in diverse communities across Dubai, including Mirdif, Damac Hills 2, and Emirates Living. While rental price growth shows signs of stabilising 7%-12% increases were still common in key areas.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Sophia MoessnerSophia Moessner,,"Dubai's expanding population continues to drive strong demand in the rental market. Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices. In the villa and townhouse segment, high activity was seen in diverse communities across Dubai, including Mirdif, Damac Hills 2, and Emirates Living. While rental price growth shows signs of stabilising 7%-12% increases were still common in key areas. Notably, some luxury communities outperformed, with average rental prices in Bluewaters (+14.1%), and villa and townhouse rentals in Palm Jumeirah (+17.0%), Dubai Hills Estate (+33.8%), and Arabian Ranches (+20.6%) seeing sharp rises.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in. Azizi’s advantage is transit access, community density, and ongoing developments that bring future value.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up.

While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Dubai’s commitment to attracting and nurturing global talent is evident in progressive policies, world-class education, and an ecosystem that values diversity, well-being, and innovation.From the DIFC Innovation Hub and the Dubai AI & Web 3.0 Campus—now the largest cluster of AI and tech companies in the region—to thriving sectors in finance, healthcare, and logistics, Dubai is a magnet for those who want to make a difference. The city’s economic growth, resilience, and relentless pursuit of excellence are a testament to what we can achieve when we dream big and work together.As an Arab, I am proud to witness and contribute to this transformation—a story not just of regional progress, but of global significance.

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore.

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Abdulrahman Bin Yahya AlhashmiAbdulrahman Bin Yahya Alhashmi,,"حبيت  أشارككم اليوم موقف يعكس نهج دولتنا الراسخ في العدل والثقة. 🇦🇪أعلنت ""إعمار مولز"" عن إعفاء إيجاري لمدة أربعة أشهر لأكثر من 50 مطعماً ومقهى في محيط نافورة دبي وسوق البحار.جاء هذا القرار بعد الإغلاق المؤقت للنافورة، حرصاً على دعم هذه الأعمال التي تعتمد عليها في حركة الزوار.وفي الوقت ذاته، تعمل إعمار على تطوير المنطقة بتركيب شاشات رقمية بطول 400 متر، لضمان تجربة مميزة للزوار خلال فترة التحديث.هذا الموقف يعيد إلى الأذهان عام 2009، حين وجّه صاحب السمو الشيخ محمد بن راشد، خلال الأزمة المالية، بدعم الأعمال والاستثمار، وحماية مكتسبات الاقتصاد الوطني.نهجنا في الإمارات ثابت:دعم الأعمال، تعزيز الثقة، والالتزام برؤية طويلة المدى لا تنكسر أمام التحديات.وهذا ما يجعل ثقة العالم في دولتنا تزداد عاماً بعد عام.I want to take a moment to appreciate how the UAE continues to stand for fairness and trust.Today’s news is another example:Emaar Malls Group is granting a four-month rent exemption to more than 50 restaurants and cafés near the Dubai Fountain and Souk Al Bahar.This comes after the temporary closure of the fountain, which many of these businesses rely on.At the same time, Emaar is upgrading the area with 400 meters of digital screens to maintain an engaging visitor experience.It reminds me of 2009, when HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum took a strong stand during the financial crisis by supporting businesses and ensuring stability.These moves show more than strategy. They reflect values—fairness, consistency, and a long-term vision.That’s why the UAE continues to earn trust.

Since 2018, it has is fully owned and operated by Abu Dhabi Ports itself part of ADQ, one of the region’s largest holding companies with a broad portfolio of major enterprises spanning key sectors of Abu Dhabi’s diversified economy. ADT was formed as part of the restructuring of the commercial ports sector in the Emirate and is the manager and operator of Khalifa Port Container Terminal (KPCT), the region’s first semi-automated and most technologically advanced terminal which was officially inaugurated on December 12, 2012. ADT's other facilities formerly included Zayed Port, a historical port that has served the capital for over 40 years and Musafah Port, located in the heart of the industrial area. Abu Dhabi Terminals was responsible for the smooth transition of container traffic from the old Zayed Port to the new Khalifa Port, located in Taweelah - midway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.In supervision of P. M. K. Hassan Siddique Sir, in the course of ""Port & Terminal Operation (PML 3103), I have given a poster presentation on a short summary of Abu Dhabi Terminals' (ADT) functions and operations.

It’s about distribution thresholds, ownership timing, and diversity of investors. Clear rules. Clearer outcomes.This update isn’t just a technical fix - it’s a reflection of the UAE’s commitment to being both competitive and compliant.

Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices. In the villa and townhouse segment, high activity was seen in diverse communities across Dubai, including Mirdif, Damac Hills 2, and Emirates Living. While rental price growth shows signs of stabilising 7%-12% increases were still common in key areas. Notably, some luxury communities outperformed, with average rental prices in Bluewaters (+14.1%), and villa and townhouse rentals in Palm Jumeirah (+17.0%), Dubai Hills Estate (+33.8%), and Arabian Ranches (+20.6%) seeing sharp rises.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Abdulrahman Bin Yahya AlhashmiAbdulrahman Bin Yahya Alhashmi,,"حبيت  أشارككم اليوم موقف يعكس نهج دولتنا الراسخ في العدل والثقة. 🇦🇪أعلنت ""إعمار مولز"" عن إعفاء إيجاري لمدة أربعة أشهر لأكثر من 50 مطعماً ومقهى في محيط نافورة دبي وسوق البحار.جاء هذا القرار بعد الإغلاق المؤقت للنافورة، حرصاً على دعم هذه الأعمال التي تعتمد عليها في حركة الزوار.وفي الوقت ذاته، تعمل إعمار على تطوير المنطقة بتركيب شاشات رقمية بطول 400 متر، لضمان تجربة مميزة للزوار خلال فترة التحديث.هذا الموقف يعيد إلى الأذهان عام 2009، حين وجّه صاحب السمو الشيخ محمد بن راشد، خلال الأزمة المالية، بدعم الأعمال والاستثمار، وحماية مكتسبات الاقتصاد الوطني.نهجنا في الإمارات ثابت:دعم الأعمال، تعزيز الثقة، والالتزام برؤية طويلة المدى لا تنكسر أمام التحديات.وهذا ما يجعل ثقة العالم في دولتنا تزداد عاماً بعد عام.I want to take a moment to appreciate how the UAE continues to stand for fairness and trust.Today’s news is another example:Emaar Malls Group is granting a four-month rent exemption to more than 50 restaurants and cafés near the Dubai Fountain and Souk Al Bahar.This comes after the temporary closure of the fountain, which many of these businesses rely on.At the same time, Emaar is upgrading the area with 400 meters of digital screens to maintain an engaging visitor experience.It reminds me of 2009, when HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum took a strong stand during the financial crisis by supporting businesses and ensuring stability.These moves show more than strategy. They reflect values—fairness, consistency, and a long-term vision.That’s why the UAE continues to earn trust.

Since 2018, it has is fully owned and operated by Abu Dhabi Ports itself part of ADQ, one of the region’s largest holding companies with a broad portfolio of major enterprises spanning key sectors of Abu Dhabi’s diversified economy. ADT was formed as part of the restructuring of the commercial ports sector in the Emirate and is the manager and operator of Khalifa Port Container Terminal (KPCT), the region’s first semi-automated and most technologically advanced terminal which was officially inaugurated on December 12, 2012. ADT's other facilities formerly included Zayed Port, a historical port that has served the capital for over 40 years and Musafah Port, located in the heart of the industrial area. Abu Dhabi Terminals was responsible for the smooth transition of container traffic from the old Zayed Port to the new Khalifa Port, located in Taweelah - midway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.In supervision of P. M. K. Hassan Siddique Sir, in the course of ""Port & Terminal Operation (PML 3103), I have given a poster presentation on a short summary of Abu Dhabi Terminals' (ADT) functions and operations.

It’s about distribution thresholds, ownership timing, and diversity of investors. Clear rules. Clearer outcomes.This update isn’t just a technical fix - it’s a reflection of the UAE’s commitment to being both competitive and compliant.

Apartments accounted for over 90% of tenancy contracts in Q1, with established communities such as Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai Marina, and Business Bay remaining top tenant choices. In the villa and townhouse segment, high activity was seen in diverse communities across Dubai, including Mirdif, Damac Hills 2, and Emirates Living. While rental price growth shows signs of stabilising 7%-12% increases were still common in key areas. Notably, some luxury communities outperformed, with average rental prices in Bluewaters (+14.1%), and villa and townhouse rentals in Palm Jumeirah (+17.0%), Dubai Hills Estate (+33.8%), and Arabian Ranches (+20.6%) seeing sharp rises.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Azizi offers locations with growth infrastructure — like Meydan — and high-demand rental communities like Al Furjan. It’s a numbers game, and they play it well.🛑 Today’s Real Objection:“With so many units coming up, will my property be easy to rent or flip?”✅ How to Overcome It:“That’s where smart positioning comes in.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Abdulrahman Bin Yahya AlhashmiAbdulrahman Bin Yahya Alhashmi,,"حبيت  أشارككم اليوم موقف يعكس نهج دولتنا الراسخ في العدل والثقة. 🇦🇪أعلنت ""إعمار مولز"" عن إعفاء إيجاري لمدة أربعة أشهر لأكثر من 50 مطعماً ومقهى في محيط نافورة دبي وسوق البحار.جاء هذا القرار بعد الإغلاق المؤقت للنافورة، حرصاً على دعم هذه الأعمال التي تعتمد عليها في حركة الزوار.وفي الوقت ذاته، تعمل إعمار على تطوير المنطقة بتركيب شاشات رقمية بطول 400 متر، لضمان تجربة مميزة للزوار خلال فترة التحديث.هذا الموقف يعيد إلى الأذهان عام 2009، حين وجّه صاحب السمو الشيخ محمد بن راشد، خلال الأزمة المالية، بدعم الأعمال والاستثمار، وحماية مكتسبات الاقتصاد الوطني.نهجنا في الإمارات ثابت:دعم الأعمال، تعزيز الثقة، والالتزام برؤية طويلة المدى لا تنكسر أمام التحديات.وهذا ما يجعل ثقة العالم في دولتنا تزداد عاماً بعد عام.I want to take a moment to appreciate how the UAE continues to stand for fairness and trust.Today’s news is another example:Emaar Malls Group is granting a four-month rent exemption to more than 50 restaurants and cafés near the Dubai Fountain and Souk Al Bahar.This comes after the temporary closure of the fountain, which many of these businesses rely on.At the same time, Emaar is upgrading the area with 400 meters of digital screens to maintain an engaging visitor experience.It reminds me of 2009, when HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum took a strong stand during the financial crisis by supporting businesses and ensuring stability.These moves show more than strategy. They reflect values—fairness, consistency, and a long-term vision.That’s why the UAE continues to earn trust.

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Abdulrahman Bin Yahya AlhashmiAbdulrahman Bin Yahya Alhashmi,,"حبيت  أشارككم اليوم موقف يعكس نهج دولتنا الراسخ في العدل والثقة. 🇦🇪أعلنت ""إعمار مولز"" عن إعفاء إيجاري لمدة أربعة أشهر لأكثر من 50 مطعماً ومقهى في محيط نافورة دبي وسوق البحار.جاء هذا القرار بعد الإغلاق المؤقت للنافورة، حرصاً على دعم هذه الأعمال التي تعتمد عليها في حركة الزوار.وفي الوقت ذاته، تعمل إعمار على تطوير المنطقة بتركيب شاشات رقمية بطول 400 متر، لضمان تجربة مميزة للزوار خلال فترة التحديث.هذا الموقف يعيد إلى الأذهان عام 2009، حين وجّه صاحب السمو الشيخ محمد بن راشد، خلال الأزمة المالية، بدعم الأعمال والاستثمار، وحماية مكتسبات الاقتصاد الوطني.نهجنا في الإمارات ثابت:دعم الأعمال، تعزيز الثقة، والالتزام برؤية طويلة المدى لا تنكسر أمام التحديات.وهذا ما يجعل ثقة العالم في دولتنا تزداد عاماً بعد عام.I want to take a moment to appreciate how the UAE continues to stand for fairness and trust.Today’s news is another example:Emaar Malls Group is granting a four-month rent exemption to more than 50 restaurants and cafés near the Dubai Fountain and Souk Al Bahar.This comes after the temporary closure of the fountain, which many of these businesses rely on.At the same time, Emaar is upgrading the area with 400 meters of digital screens to maintain an engaging visitor experience.It reminds me of 2009, when HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum took a strong stand during the financial crisis by supporting businesses and ensuring stability.These moves show more than strategy. They reflect values—fairness, consistency, and a long-term vision.That’s why the UAE continues to earn trust.

"Devika Raveendran, LL.M, TEPDevika Raveendran, LL.M, TEP",,"Since I relocated to the UAE in 2007, one of the most frequently debated topics has been the role and limitations of Free Zone entities—particularly the ambiguity around whether they can conduct business on the mainland, with or without a mainland agent, or through indirect arrangements. These questions have often led to confusion about the very need for separate Free Zone and mainland structures. However, recent regulatory and economic reforms in the UAE have brought greater clarity and flexibility, aligning with the country's broader vision to remain a globally competitive, business-friendly jurisdiction.Free Zones in the UAE continue to offer significant advantages such as 100% foreign ownership, full repatriation of profits and capital, streamlined licensing processes, and access to world-class infrastructure. Additionally, many Free Zones are sector-specific—such as Dubai Internet City for tech or DMCC for commodities—offering tailored ecosystems that foster innovation, networking, and growth.In the past years, the lines between mainland and Free Zone business activities have started to blur. Reforms like the amendment of the Commercial Companies Law have allowed for 100% foreign ownership in most of the mainland sectors, and regulatory bodies have adopted more pragmatic approaches that facilitate inter-zone and mainland business interactions. This evolution means that Free Zone entities can now more confidently participate in the UAE’s broader economy, often through structured legal frameworks, without undermining their core Free Zone benefits.These developments collectively signify that choosing between a Free Zone or mainland setup no longer needs to be a binary decision. Instead, businesses can strategically align their structure with their growth trajectory, operational needs, and market access requirements—making the UAE one of the most adaptive and investor-centric destinations globally.We're here to help you navigate the best path for your business.Bhaskar DasguptaGayatri RokadeSahima Chawla Sathya Prakash hashtag#uae hashtag#freezone hashtag#uaecompany hashtag#companyformations hashtag#mainlandcompany hashtag#freezonecompany hashtag#businessincorporations hashtag#companysetup

Vivek Vijay ChavanVivek Vijay Chavan,,"🟧 Let’s talk about a very ignored topic: how we speak to each other at work.It’s 2025 — AI is driving innovation, businesses are transforming rapidly, and the workplace is more dynamic than ever.Yet, one simple principle often gets overlooked: respectful communication.Across industries, it’s still not uncommon to witness situations where colleagues are spoken to in a harsh or loud tone, sometimes even in front of others. While some may dismiss it as a “heat of the moment” reaction — in reality, it’s unprofessional, damaging, and unacceptable.🔹 Raising your voice doesn’t raise your point.🔹 It erodes trust, psychological safety, and the kind of culture every team needs to truly succeed.We’re fortunate that at Etihad, we have a dedicated team that actively supports employee well-being and ensures workplace behavior aligns with respect and professionalism. Not every organization may have such systems in place — and that’s exactly why conversations like this matter.In the UAE, the law is clear:Under Federal Decree Law No. 33 of 2021, employees are protected against verbal abuse, public humiliation, or any form of workplace hostility.If you’re in a workplace where such behavior is repeated or goes unchecked:✔️ Raise the concern internally through proper channels✔️ If it remains unresolved, you have every right to approach MOHRE or the appropriate legal authoritiesNo job should come at the cost of your self-respect.Put your dignity above the work, the titles, and the paycheques.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Lara Koch de Brito JorgeLara Koch de Brito Jorge,,"Why is everyone moving to Dubai? And why it actually makes so much sense.You’ve probably noticed - everyone seems to be moving to Dubai lately. And it’s no longer just influencers showing off skyline views and flashy lifestyles. Entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and professionals across industries are packing their bags and calling the UAE home. So… why is this happening? (And why it actually makes a lot of sense)First of all, it is no longer simply a concrete jungle in the desert. As you see from the pictures I took, you can also live in a rather Mediterranean atmosphere. You have multiple areas that provide you with every type of lifestyle and quality of life (urban, rural, suburban, coastal/ resort areas, gated compounds, you name it...). Additionally: 💼 Business-Friendly Environment Dubai has positioned itself as one of the most attractive hubs for global business. With zero income tax, easy company setup processes, and growing investor confidence, it’s a magnet for founders and freelancers alike. You don’t have to be a millionaire to make it work - you just have to be strategic.🌍 Gateway Between East and West Dubai’s location makes it a perfect springboard for international work. 8-hour flight to London. 7 to Singapore. Quick trips to the Maldives, Lebanon, or Europe. It’s global living, without compromise.🏙 Innovation + Infrastructure From AI-driven services to futuristic architecture, Dubai doesn’t play small. You feel like you’re part of something that’s constantly evolving. The city is built to inspire ambition, and that’s magnetic.🌞 Quality of Life Luxury meets convenience. Safe streets, incredible hospitality, endless dining and leisure options, beach clubs, five-star everything - and 350 days of sun? It's the lifestyle that turns a ""short-term move"" into ""I might just stay.""🤝 Networking Like Nowhere Else Here, your next investor, collaborator, or client could be sitting next to you at dinner. Dubai’s expat community is full of driven, like-minded people from all over the world. If you’re building something, this is where deals are made and conversations become opportunities.💡 Future-Focused Mindset Smart cities, global events, AI - Dubai isn’t waiting around for the future. It’s actively building it. And those who want to be part of tomorrow are starting today, right here.So yes, there’s a reason the world is moving to Dubai. And whether for personal or business reasons perhaps it is worth your consideration too...hashtag#WhyDubai

Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up.

Abdulrahman Bin Yahya AlhashmiAbdulrahman Bin Yahya Alhashmi,,"حبيت  أشارككم اليوم موقف يعكس نهج دولتنا الراسخ في العدل والثقة. 🇦🇪أعلنت ""إعمار مولز"" عن إعفاء إيجاري لمدة أربعة أشهر لأكثر من 50 مطعماً ومقهى في محيط نافورة دبي وسوق البحار.جاء هذا القرار بعد الإغلاق المؤقت للنافورة، حرصاً على دعم هذه الأعمال التي تعتمد عليها في حركة الزوار.وفي الوقت ذاته، تعمل إعمار على تطوير المنطقة بتركيب شاشات رقمية بطول 400 متر، لضمان تجربة مميزة للزوار خلال فترة التحديث.هذا الموقف يعيد إلى الأذهان عام 2009، حين وجّه صاحب السمو الشيخ محمد بن راشد، خلال الأزمة المالية، بدعم الأعمال والاستثمار، وحماية مكتسبات الاقتصاد الوطني.نهجنا في الإمارات ثابت:دعم الأعمال، تعزيز الثقة، والالتزام برؤية طويلة المدى لا تنكسر أمام التحديات.وهذا ما يجعل ثقة العالم في دولتنا تزداد عاماً بعد عام.I want to take a moment to appreciate how the UAE continues to stand for fairness and trust.Today’s news is another example:Emaar Malls Group is granting a four-month rent exemption to more than 50 restaurants and cafés near the Dubai Fountain and Souk Al Bahar.This comes after the temporary closure of the fountain, which many of these businesses rely on.At the same time, Emaar is upgrading the area with 400 meters of digital screens to maintain an engaging visitor experience.It reminds me of 2009, when HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum took a strong stand during the financial crisis by supporting businesses and ensuring stability.These moves show more than strategy. They reflect values—fairness, consistency, and a long-term vision.That’s why the UAE continues to earn trust.

"Devika Raveendran, LL.M, TEPDevika Raveendran, LL.M, TEP",,"Since I relocated to the UAE in 2007, one of the most frequently debated topics has been the role and limitations of Free Zone entities—particularly the ambiguity around whether they can conduct business on the mainland, with or without a mainland agent, or through indirect arrangements. These questions have often led to confusion about the very need for separate Free Zone and mainland structures. However, recent regulatory and economic reforms in the UAE have brought greater clarity and flexibility, aligning with the country's broader vision to remain a globally competitive, business-friendly jurisdiction.Free Zones in the UAE continue to offer significant advantages such as 100% foreign ownership, full repatriation of profits and capital, streamlined licensing processes, and access to world-class infrastructure. Additionally, many Free Zones are sector-specific—such as Dubai Internet City for tech or DMCC for commodities—offering tailored ecosystems that foster innovation, networking, and growth.In the past years, the lines between mainland and Free Zone business activities have started to blur. Reforms like the amendment of the Commercial Companies Law have allowed for 100% foreign ownership in most of the mainland sectors, and regulatory bodies have adopted more pragmatic approaches that facilitate inter-zone and mainland business interactions. This evolution means that Free Zone entities can now more confidently participate in the UAE’s broader economy, often through structured legal frameworks, without undermining their core Free Zone benefits.These developments collectively signify that choosing between a Free Zone or mainland setup no longer needs to be a binary decision. Instead, businesses can strategically align their structure with their growth trajectory, operational needs, and market access requirements—making the UAE one of the most adaptive and investor-centric destinations globally.We're here to help you navigate the best path for your business.Bhaskar DasguptaGayatri RokadeSahima Chawla Sathya Prakash hashtag#uae hashtag#freezone hashtag#uaecompany hashtag#companyformations hashtag#mainlandcompany hashtag#freezonecompany hashtag#businessincorporations hashtag#companysetup
