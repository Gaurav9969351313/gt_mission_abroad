Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Affan SamadAffan Samad,,"🔍 LINQ Tip: OrderBy() vs ThenBy() – Sort Smarter, Not Harder!Need to sort your data on multiple fields? LINQ has you covered with OrderBy() and ThenBy() — but using them correctly makes all the difference.✅ OrderBy() Sorts a sequence in ascending order based on the first key. This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order? Use OrderByDescending() and ThenByDescending() similarly.🎯 Mastering OrderBy/ThenBy makes your data presentation clean, predictable, and professional.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp hashtag#LINQ hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#programmingtips hashtag#developerslife

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order? Use OrderByDescending() and ThenByDescending() similarly.🎯 Mastering OrderBy/ThenBy makes your data presentation clean, predictable, and professional.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp hashtag#LINQ hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#programmingtips hashtag#developerslife

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

But I still believe in relationships that last beyond one placement.To everyone out there — vendors, clients, recruiters, consultants — If you’re building something real, something consistent, something based on trust…You’ll always find me doing the same.hashtag#ClientRelationshipManager hashtag#BenchSales hashtag#USITStaffing hashtag#WhiteVendors hashtag#TrustBasedWork hashtag#RelationshipsOverDeals hashtag#StaffingWithHeart hashtag#ProfessionalConnections hashtag#VendorNetwork hashtag#PeopleMatter hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

This is your primary sort.✅ ThenBy() Applies a secondary sort (or more) after the initial OrderBy().📌 Want descending order? Use OrderByDescending() and ThenByDescending() similarly.🎯 Mastering OrderBy/ThenBy makes your data presentation clean, predictable, and professional.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp hashtag#LINQ hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#programmingtips hashtag#developerslife

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

But I still believe in relationships that last beyond one placement.To everyone out there — vendors, clients, recruiters, consultants — If you’re building something real, something consistent, something based on trust…You’ll always find me doing the same.hashtag#ClientRelationshipManager hashtag#BenchSales hashtag#USITStaffing hashtag#WhiteVendors hashtag#TrustBasedWork hashtag#RelationshipsOverDeals hashtag#StaffingWithHeart hashtag#ProfessionalConnections hashtag#VendorNetwork hashtag#PeopleMatter hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

sukesh ssukesh s,,"""How to Build Long-Term Client Relationships"" Anyone can close a deal. But can you build a repeat client? Here’s what I focus on every day: 1️⃣ Be Available — Especially when things go wrong. 2️⃣ Be Honest — No fake promises. No ghosting. 3️⃣ Be Curious — Ask what they need, not what you want to sell. 4️⃣ Be Consistent — It's not a one-time effort. It's long-term follow-through.A true client relationship is when they say: ""We’ll wait till you get back to us."" Not: “We’re going with someone else.”Are you building trust or just transactions?

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Rhèma RocQuemoreRhèma RocQuemore,,"It really bothers me how dismissive and short in disposition some of you recruiters come across. It’s very disheartening that your sense of compassion and empathy is non existent to the point that some of you come across as a little rude when someone contacts you regarding roles that YOU POST AND ADVERTISE TELLING US TO REACH OUT TO YOU…. Are you just posting for traction or are you genuinely trying to help others get back on their feet by way of getting a new job??? I’m really trying to understand the method to some of your madness….. It really breaks my heart to have experienced this from some of you on this platform and it really makes me sad when I see other job seekers post how they’re losing everything due to being unable to find work. Having a heart, compassion, understanding, empathy and discernment can really mean the world to someone in their dire time of need❤️. It takes absolutely nothing to put yourself in the shoes of others. It’s our day today but could very well be YOURS TOMORROW. My prayers are with everyone that’s currently in my shoes of struggling with finding their next role. I hope and pray that we all land our next roles SOON and that it’s everything that we need and more 🙏🏾.🩷It would mean THE WORLD TO ME if I found a recruiter that is willing to help me land my next role like some of you do with your “favorites” or chosen few who you help on this platform. If someone would take a chance on me I promise you that you won’t regret it🩷Here are a list of my jobs of interest in case you are willing to assist me 🥰.hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#SupplyChainhashtag#Procurementhashtag#BusinessOperations hashtag#LogisticsPlease don’t ask me to send any connection request if you’re not hiring for a role, please inbox me asking to schedule a conference to review my resume or to just chat.

Nawaf MahsounNawaf Mahsoun,,"🔍 Equality in C#: == vs Equals()Hey folks!I’ve run into subtle bugs in my code more than once, only to discover the root cause was how I was comparing objects. In C#, == and Equals() seem to do the same thing—until they surprise you with unexpected behavior.Here’s my personal cheat sheet on the key differences—no fluff, just clarity to help you write cleaner, less error-prone code.🔹 The == OperatorCompile-time binding → Decided by the compilerReference types → Checks if both variables point to the same objectValue types → Compares the actual values; for custom structs, you’ll need to overload itNull-safe → null == null is true, null == non-null is false🔹 The Equals() MethodRuntime binding → Supports overrides and polymorphismReference types → Default compares references, but can be overridden for content comparisonValue types → Uses reflection to compare fields (not very performant—consider overriding)Null handling → a.Equals(b) throws if a is null → prefer object.Equals(a, b) for safety📖 A Real-Life AnalogyImagine two copies of The Great Gatsby:==: “Are these the exact same physical book?”Equals(): “Do these books contain the same text?”📝 Quick Code Sampleclass Book { public string Title; public override bool Equals(object obj) => obj is Book b && Title == b.Title; public static bool operator ==(Book a, Book b) => object.Equals(a, b); public static bool operator !=(Book a, Book b) => !object.Equals(a, b); public override int GetHashCode() => Title?.GetHashCode() ?? 0;}🚦 When to Use Which?Pro tip: If you override Equals(), always override GetHashCode() too. It’s essential for correct behavior in dictionaries and hash-based collections.👇 What’s the trickiest equality bug you’ve solved in C#?
