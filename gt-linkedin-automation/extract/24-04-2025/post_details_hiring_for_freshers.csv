Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped.

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut. Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut. Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings. And let’s report the fakes when we see them.🔍 Has anyone here ever actually landed a job by commenting ""YES"" on one of these posts?Would love to hear your experiences—did it work? Or was it just a trap? Let’s share so we can all be more informed.hashtag#JobScam hashtag#LinkedInAwareness hashtag#JaagrukBano hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#CareerTips hashtag#RealTalk

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut. Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings. And let’s report the fakes when we see them.🔍 Has anyone here ever actually landed a job by commenting ""YES"" on one of these posts?Would love to hear your experiences—did it work?

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code.

How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut. Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings. And let’s report the fakes when we see them.🔍 Has anyone here ever actually landed a job by commenting ""YES"" on one of these posts?Would love to hear your experiences—did it work?

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut. Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings. And let’s report the fakes when we see them.🔍 Has anyone here ever actually landed a job by commenting ""YES"" on one of these posts?Would love to hear your experiences—did it work?

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut. Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut. Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings. And let’s report the fakes when we see them.🔍 Has anyone here ever actually landed a job by commenting ""YES"" on one of these posts?Would love to hear your experiences—did it work? Or was it just a trap? Let’s share so we can all be more informed.hashtag#JobScam hashtag#LinkedInAwareness hashtag#JaagrukBano hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#CareerTips hashtag#RealTalk

Ismail MalikIsmail Malik,,"Life is a journey, and along this path, we're constantly evolving and growing. Sometimes, we encounter challenges that make us question our progress, but it's essential to remember one crucial piece of advice: don't give up on the person you're becoming.Real success does not happen in the blink of an eye. You can't just wish to accomplish something and expect that it will be given to you quickly. Real success comes with pain, winning over trials, overcoming obstacles, and persevering despite various failures.Significant things such as job promotion, graduation, a new house, relationships, and overcoming pains are defining moments of your perseverance and efforts. All these are the results of yourself who chose to continue reaching for the goals instead of stopping and giving up. A never give up attitude can be used to abolish doubts and negative thinking to make you stronger in facing everything.We’ve probably all heard the famous saying ‘when one door closes, another opens’. This is especially important to remember during hard times when things are a struggle and we feel like life is beating us down. If you are finding life stressful, a reminder that good things are around the corner can really help to lift your mood and cultivate a sense of hope. The reality is that growth and change are critical to success. We can’t stay just as we are. We have to adapt and evolve, internally and externally, in all areas of life. We’ve got to be flexible, we’ve got to try new things, break out of old habits and patterns, experiment, get out of our comfort zones and so on – until we reach our goals. Not giving up doesn’t mean just doing the same thing over and over until it works.  It means doing different things, new things until it works. If you’re not willing to change and try those new things, you will inevitably give up far too soon.If you give up on the things that matter most to you, you will likely establish a pattern of giving up on anything when things don't go the way you hoped. You will not learn the importance of persistence and anything worthwhile requires persistence.""Energy and persistence conquer all things."" -- Benjamin Franklinhashtag#tip hashtag#quoteoftheday hashtag#quotes hashtag#thoughts hashtag#tipoftheday hashtag#thoughtoftheday hashtag#job hashtag#hiring hashtag#skills hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#interview hashtag#india hashtag#canada hashtag#usa hashtag#uk hashtag#germany hashtag#france hashtag#italy hashtag#ai hashtag#ml hashtag#spain hashtag#england hashtag#asia hashtag#africa hashtag#america hashtag#australia hashtag#europe hashtag#indonesia hashtag#japan hashtag#brazil hashtag#china hashtag#pakistan hashtag#russia hashtag#dubai hashtag#gulf hashtag#it hashtag#cs hashtag#ds hashtag#da hashtag#linkedin hashtag#datascience hashtag#dataanalyst hashtag#learning hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#computerscience hashtag#management hashtag#engineering hashtag#healthcare hashtag#pharmacy hashtag#leadership hashtag#contentcreator hashtag#contentwriting hashtag#author hashtag#creative hashtag#artist hashtag#writer hashtag#article hashtag#motivational hashtag#tedtalk hashtag#positivevibes hashtag#mindfullness hashtag#mindsermatters hashtag#growthmindset hashtag#personalitydevelopment hashtag#education hashtag#teaching hashtag#fresher hashtag#lifelesson hashtag#truepurpose hashtag#reading hashtag#mindbodysoul hashtag#mindset hashtag#purpose hashtag#newpost hashtag#positivemindset hashtag#success hashtag#failure hashtag#growth hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#nevergiveup hashtag#neverquit

Suruchi SinghSuruchi Singh,,"AI can write code. Google has most of the answers.So why are we still testing mid-career professionals like it’s 2005?Job search as a mid-career tech professional hits different.You could have 12+ years of experience,led cross-functional teams, delivered impact, adapted to tech shifts but step into an interview, and it’s all reduced to this:“Write this code… right now… under pressure.”It’s not that I can’t do it. I can. But I often walk away thinking: did my experience matter at all in that room?We live in a time where AI writes, tests, and improves code. Where tech learning is more accessible than ever -  from students to self-taught professionals, even homemakers picking up Python from their kitchens. Its mandatory to be aligned with AI tools for your job.And in this world of limitless learning,“Google can give you the right answer  but can you ask the right question?”That's what experience teaches. How to think through problems. How to ask better questions. How to solve with clarity - not just code fast.I’m not dismissing the importance of DSA.It sharpens structure, logic, and approach -  I get why FAANGs rely on it.But what if candidate  matched the assessment style to the actual role they’re hiring for?Because real work isn't just about clean syntax.It's about communication, product thinking, making trade-offs, and knowing what matters when everything feels urgent. ✅ Give candidates a broken user story to fix ✅ Run a pair-programming session ✅ Ask them to debug or prioritize under ambiguity ✅ Include collaborative group discussions — like we did back in our fresher days ✅ See how they make decisions, not just solve puzzlesThose scenarios tell you way more about a person than a timer ever will. You can train someone in a stack. But you can’t train ownership. You can’t train how they show up when things go wrong, or how they collaborate under pressure.And if we keep filtering talent only through tight technical loops,we risk missing people who could’ve thrived  if only we assessed the full picture.Did you’ve ever walked out of an interview wondering,""Did my experience even matter?""  What’s one thing you wish interviews focused more on  especially for experienced professionals?Let’s talk about it. It’s time we evolved not just what we test, but why.

Not because they’re careless—but because they’re hopeful. Because they want to believe it’s true.💡 Here’s how to spot job scams on LinkedIn: ✔️ No official company tag or career page link✔️ Vague roles and unrealistic salaries✔️ No job description or selection criteria✔️ Posts asking for likes/comments to “apply”✔️ Personal DMs with promises that feel off✨ To those job-hunting:Don’t let desperation silence your gut. Always verify. Always ask questions. You deserve better than a fake promise.📢 To those hiring:Let’s post clearer, more transparent openings.
