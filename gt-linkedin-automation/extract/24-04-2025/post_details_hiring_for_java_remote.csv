Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up. Kwanda’s support and shown us how it’s done. Now I’d like to help them do even more.Mr. Jermaine Craig I'm fully ready to join your team!

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Zara WangchukZara Wangchuk,112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook,"PRE-QUALIFICATION METHODOLOGY – VETASSESS Skills Assessment!Pre-qualification experience refers to work experience gained prior to completing your formal qualification (such as a diploma or bachelor’s degree). VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Muhammad UsmanMuhammad Usman,,"There’s this thing – that hasn’t made me admire Kwanda any less. If anything, it’s made me realize just how much I want to be part of what they’re building. Kwanda represents something rare a platform that actually trusts communities to know what they need. While others throw money at problems without sustainable drivers, Kwanda listens first. They understand that real change isn’t about grand gestures, but about empowering people to build their own solutions with full sustainability framework.What gets me is how they have created this bridge between diasporans who want to help and communities ready to do the work. It’s not charity. It’s partnership.I have watched them back projects that others would overlook the kind that don’t make flashy headlines but actually change lives. There’s a humility to their approach that’s stuck with me. They don’t pretend to have all the answers. They just create space for the right ones to emerge. Maybe this is the right time? All I know is this when our paths finally cross, I'm ready. Not just with skills, but with the same stubborn belief that change works best when it starts from the ground up.

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity
