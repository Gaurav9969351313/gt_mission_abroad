Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust.

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Other times, it looks like sitting in a hottub in the mountains with a view—laptop closed, soaking in the freedom you built.Working from home is really about working from anywhere.It’s about building a life where you don’t have to choose between time with your family and building your future.I used to think freedom was just a dream.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Maciek SzadkowskiMaciek Szadkowski,,"Yesterday, I was stunned by the performance numbers advertised by a major player in the hashtag#liquidcooling industry (see: https://lnkd.in/d7S4XkB5?) ...aaaaand within a single day, a new 2 Megawatt (2,269kW) CDU morphed into ..1,415kW CDU. I appreciate your clarification, CoolIT Systems, but earlier posts remain misleading, and your website still falsely claims a 2 MW CDU with full N+1 redundancy.ps. I get bold marketing, and specs may not always be spot-on, but that CDU was just advertised as 2MW + fully redundant, and it’s not. There’s got to be a line! Overstating performance or claiming nonexistent features must stop.

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Julio CésarJulio César,,"🚀 Java 21: Smarter Switch with Pattern MatchingJava’s switch just got a major upgrade! With pattern matching in Java 21, we can now match against types like String, Integer, record, and even sealed hierarchies — all with cleaner and safer syntax.✨ Highlights:Use switch with types and conditions (when clauses).No more boilerplate instanceof + casting.Full support for record and sealed interface patterns.Exhaustiveness checks eliminate the need for default cases.Works great with enums too!This feature makes Java code more expressive and less verbose — ideal for domain modeling and polymorphic logic.👉 A must-try for modern Java devs. I’m already updating my projects with it.

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4.

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

Franco PereyraFranco Pereyra,,"Global remote workers get paid less than Americans for the same job... And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

Franco PereyraFranco Pereyra,,"Global remote workers get paid less than Americans for the same job... And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

Franco PereyraFranco Pereyra,,"Global remote workers get paid less than Americans for the same job... And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust.

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4.

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

Franco PereyraFranco Pereyra,,"Global remote workers get paid less than Americans for the same job... And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Vikram SVikram S,,"Title: Java Program to Analyze Student MarksIntroduction:This Java program is designed to assist in analyzing student performance by collecting marks for a fixed set of subjects and then computing useful insights such as the total marks, average, highest and lowest marks, and the corresponding subjects.Functionality Overview:The program begins by prompting the user to enter marks for a predefined list of subjects: Tamil, English, Maths, Science, and Social. The marks entered by the user are stored in an integer array.Core Processing:Once the marks are collected, the program performs the following tasks:1. Total Marks Calculation: It adds up all the marks using a loop.2. Average Marks: The total is divided by the number of subjects to get the average.3. Identifying Extremes: It finds the highest and lowest marks by comparing each subject's score. Along with the marks, the program also tracks which subjects have these scores.Output:After processing the data, the program displays:Total marksAverage marksThe subject with the highest marksThe subject with the lowest marksConclusion:This program is a simple yet effective example of how arrays, loops, and conditionals can be used in Java to manage and analyze student data. It helps reinforce key programming concepts while being practical for real-world applications like report card generation.hashtag#snsinstitutions hashtag#snsdesignthikers hashtag#designthinking

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Vikram SVikram S,,"Title: Java Program to Analyze Student MarksIntroduction:This Java program is designed to assist in analyzing student performance by collecting marks for a fixed set of subjects and then computing useful insights such as the total marks, average, highest and lowest marks, and the corresponding subjects.Functionality Overview:The program begins by prompting the user to enter marks for a predefined list of subjects: Tamil, English, Maths, Science, and Social. The marks entered by the user are stored in an integer array.Core Processing:Once the marks are collected, the program performs the following tasks:1. Total Marks Calculation: It adds up all the marks using a loop.2. Average Marks: The total is divided by the number of subjects to get the average.3. Identifying Extremes: It finds the highest and lowest marks by comparing each subject's score. Along with the marks, the program also tracks which subjects have these scores.Output:After processing the data, the program displays:Total marksAverage marksThe subject with the highest marksThe subject with the lowest marksConclusion:This program is a simple yet effective example of how arrays, loops, and conditionals can be used in Java to manage and analyze student data. It helps reinforce key programming concepts while being practical for real-world applications like report card generation.hashtag#snsinstitutions hashtag#snsdesignthikers hashtag#designthinking

ALI ADELALI ADEL,,"هل تصميم المخزن عندك بيخدم التشغيل... ولا بيعطّله؟في المخازن، مش بس المعدات أو النظام اللي بيأثر على الكفاءة... تصميم المخزن نفسه ممكن يكون هو الفارق بين التشغيل السلس والتكدس والعشوائية!من خلال خبرتي في مجال قطع الغيار والمخازن، لاحظت إن في 5 عناصر تصميم أساسية بتحدد نجاح أو فشل أي مخزن:1. تخطيط تدفق العمل (Flow Design):تصميم المسارات يبدأ من الاستلام (Receiving) مرورًا بالتخزين (Putaway) وانتهاء بالتجهيز (Picking) والشحن (Dispatch).كل خطوة لازم تكون مترابطة بمسار واضح لتقليل الحركة العشوائية.الفصل بين مناطق الإدخال والإخراج يمنع التداخل ويقلل الأخطاء.2. تخصيص المناطق (Zoning):كل نوع مخزون له طبيعة معينة:المواد السريعة الحركة (Fast-Moving) توضع قرب مناطق الشحن.المواد الثقيلة تحتاج مناطق أرضية وقريبة من ممرات الرافعات.الأصناف الراكدة تخزن في أماكن بعيدة لتوفير المساحة.3. الكثافة التخزينية مقابل الوصول السريع (Storage Density vs. Accessibility):الأنظمة عالية الكثافة (مثل Drive-In أو Push Back) بتوفر مساحة، لكن تقلل سرعة الوصول.أنظمة الرفوف المفتوحة (Selective Racking) أسرع في الوصول، لكنها تستهلك مساحة أكبر.التوازن هنا مهم حسب طبيعة الأصناف وحجم الطلب.4. مرونة التوسع والتعديل:لازم التصميم يسمح بإعادة ترتيب الأقسام بسهولة حسب تغير طبيعة التشغيل أو حجم المخزون.تركيب أنظمة رفوف قابلة للتعديل بيتيح إعادة التنظيم بدون تكاليف كبيرة.5. دمج التكنولوجيا في التصميم:لو بتخطط تستخدم WMS أو أنظمة تتبع بالأكواد (Barcode/RFID)، لازم التصميم يدعم:نقاط مسح عند كل مرحلة.مناطق شحن واستلام مهيأة للقراءة السريعة والدقة العالية.خلاصة:التصميم مش مرحلة لمرة واحدة... ده عنصر مستمر بيتطور مع تغير نوعية المخزون، حجم الطلب، وطبيعة التشغيل.التصميم الجيد يقلل الزمن الضائع، يقلل الحوادث، يزيد الدقة، ويخلي التشغيل مرن وسلس.هل سبق لك شاركت في إعادة تصميم أو تطوير مخزن؟شاركني بأفكارك أو التحديات اللي واجهتها!hashtag#WarehouseDesign hashtag#WarehouseEfficiency hashtag#LogisticsOptimization hashtag#SupplyChainManagement hashtag#LeanWarehouse hashtag#AliAdel hashtag#إدارة_المخازن

Абылкайырхан СарсетаевАбылкайырхан Сарсетаев,,"🚗🔌 Implementing BLE for Car Connectivity in Android 🔌🚗I'm excited to share a feature I've recently implemented in Jetem app, where I integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect and communicate with a vehicle. The core of the functionality allows the app to: • Discover the car: Using BLE scanning, I can find the car's Bluetooth device. • Connect: Once the car is found, the app establishes a connection via Bluetooth GATT. • Send Commands: After the connection, I can send commands such as open or close the car doors, which are transmitted securely using BLE.Here’s an overview of how it works:1. BLE Scanning: The app scans for nearby Bluetooth devices, specifically targeting the car’s Bluetooth signal.2. Connection: Upon finding the target device, it initiates the GATT connection.3. Command Handling: Once connected, commands like ""auth"", ""open door"" or ""close door"" are sent and executed via Bluetooth characteristics and descriptors.4. Real-time Updates: The app listens for notifications from the car, ensuring actions are performed successfully and feedback is received promptly.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4.

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

Franco PereyraFranco Pereyra,,"Global remote workers get paid less than Americans for the same job... And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Vikram SVikram S,,"Title: Java Program to Analyze Student MarksIntroduction:This Java program is designed to assist in analyzing student performance by collecting marks for a fixed set of subjects and then computing useful insights such as the total marks, average, highest and lowest marks, and the corresponding subjects.Functionality Overview:The program begins by prompting the user to enter marks for a predefined list of subjects: Tamil, English, Maths, Science, and Social. The marks entered by the user are stored in an integer array.Core Processing:Once the marks are collected, the program performs the following tasks:1. Total Marks Calculation: It adds up all the marks using a loop.2. Average Marks: The total is divided by the number of subjects to get the average.3. Identifying Extremes: It finds the highest and lowest marks by comparing each subject's score. Along with the marks, the program also tracks which subjects have these scores.Output:After processing the data, the program displays:Total marksAverage marksThe subject with the highest marksThe subject with the lowest marksConclusion:This program is a simple yet effective example of how arrays, loops, and conditionals can be used in Java to manage and analyze student data. It helps reinforce key programming concepts while being practical for real-world applications like report card generation.hashtag#snsinstitutions hashtag#snsdesignthikers hashtag#designthinking

ALI ADELALI ADEL,,"هل تصميم المخزن عندك بيخدم التشغيل... ولا بيعطّله؟في المخازن، مش بس المعدات أو النظام اللي بيأثر على الكفاءة... تصميم المخزن نفسه ممكن يكون هو الفارق بين التشغيل السلس والتكدس والعشوائية!من خلال خبرتي في مجال قطع الغيار والمخازن، لاحظت إن في 5 عناصر تصميم أساسية بتحدد نجاح أو فشل أي مخزن:1. تخطيط تدفق العمل (Flow Design):تصميم المسارات يبدأ من الاستلام (Receiving) مرورًا بالتخزين (Putaway) وانتهاء بالتجهيز (Picking) والشحن (Dispatch).كل خطوة لازم تكون مترابطة بمسار واضح لتقليل الحركة العشوائية.الفصل بين مناطق الإدخال والإخراج يمنع التداخل ويقلل الأخطاء.2. تخصيص المناطق (Zoning):كل نوع مخزون له طبيعة معينة:المواد السريعة الحركة (Fast-Moving) توضع قرب مناطق الشحن.المواد الثقيلة تحتاج مناطق أرضية وقريبة من ممرات الرافعات.الأصناف الراكدة تخزن في أماكن بعيدة لتوفير المساحة.3. الكثافة التخزينية مقابل الوصول السريع (Storage Density vs. Accessibility):الأنظمة عالية الكثافة (مثل Drive-In أو Push Back) بتوفر مساحة، لكن تقلل سرعة الوصول.أنظمة الرفوف المفتوحة (Selective Racking) أسرع في الوصول، لكنها تستهلك مساحة أكبر.التوازن هنا مهم حسب طبيعة الأصناف وحجم الطلب.4. مرونة التوسع والتعديل:لازم التصميم يسمح بإعادة ترتيب الأقسام بسهولة حسب تغير طبيعة التشغيل أو حجم المخزون.تركيب أنظمة رفوف قابلة للتعديل بيتيح إعادة التنظيم بدون تكاليف كبيرة.5. دمج التكنولوجيا في التصميم:لو بتخطط تستخدم WMS أو أنظمة تتبع بالأكواد (Barcode/RFID)، لازم التصميم يدعم:نقاط مسح عند كل مرحلة.مناطق شحن واستلام مهيأة للقراءة السريعة والدقة العالية.خلاصة:التصميم مش مرحلة لمرة واحدة... ده عنصر مستمر بيتطور مع تغير نوعية المخزون، حجم الطلب، وطبيعة التشغيل.التصميم الجيد يقلل الزمن الضائع، يقلل الحوادث، يزيد الدقة، ويخلي التشغيل مرن وسلس.هل سبق لك شاركت في إعادة تصميم أو تطوير مخزن؟شاركني بأفكارك أو التحديات اللي واجهتها!hashtag#WarehouseDesign hashtag#WarehouseEfficiency hashtag#LogisticsOptimization hashtag#SupplyChainManagement hashtag#LeanWarehouse hashtag#AliAdel hashtag#إدارة_المخازن

The core of the functionality allows the app to: • Discover the car: Using BLE scanning, I can find the car's Bluetooth device. • Connect: Once the car is found, the app establishes a connection via Bluetooth GATT. • Send Commands: After the connection, I can send commands such as open or close the car doors, which are transmitted securely using BLE.Here’s an overview of how it works:1. BLE Scanning: The app scans for nearby Bluetooth devices, specifically targeting the car’s Bluetooth signal.2. Connection: Upon finding the target device, it initiates the GATT connection.3. Command Handling: Once connected, commands like ""auth"", ""open door"" or ""close door"" are sent and executed via Bluetooth characteristics and descriptors.4. Real-time Updates: The app listens for notifications from the car, ensuring actions are performed successfully and feedback is received promptly.

You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Vikram SVikram S,,"Title: Java Program to Analyze Student MarksIntroduction:This Java program is designed to assist in analyzing student performance by collecting marks for a fixed set of subjects and then computing useful insights such as the total marks, average, highest and lowest marks, and the corresponding subjects.Functionality Overview:The program begins by prompting the user to enter marks for a predefined list of subjects: Tamil, English, Maths, Science, and Social. The marks entered by the user are stored in an integer array.Core Processing:Once the marks are collected, the program performs the following tasks:1. Total Marks Calculation: It adds up all the marks using a loop.2. Average Marks: The total is divided by the number of subjects to get the average.3. Identifying Extremes: It finds the highest and lowest marks by comparing each subject's score. Along with the marks, the program also tracks which subjects have these scores.Output:After processing the data, the program displays:Total marksAverage marksThe subject with the highest marksThe subject with the lowest marksConclusion:This program is a simple yet effective example of how arrays, loops, and conditionals can be used in Java to manage and analyze student data. It helps reinforce key programming concepts while being practical for real-world applications like report card generation.hashtag#snsinstitutions hashtag#snsdesignthikers hashtag#designthinking

ALI ADELALI ADEL,,"هل تصميم المخزن عندك بيخدم التشغيل... ولا بيعطّله؟في المخازن، مش بس المعدات أو النظام اللي بيأثر على الكفاءة... تصميم المخزن نفسه ممكن يكون هو الفارق بين التشغيل السلس والتكدس والعشوائية!من خلال خبرتي في مجال قطع الغيار والمخازن، لاحظت إن في 5 عناصر تصميم أساسية بتحدد نجاح أو فشل أي مخزن:1. تخطيط تدفق العمل (Flow Design):تصميم المسارات يبدأ من الاستلام (Receiving) مرورًا بالتخزين (Putaway) وانتهاء بالتجهيز (Picking) والشحن (Dispatch).كل خطوة لازم تكون مترابطة بمسار واضح لتقليل الحركة العشوائية.الفصل بين مناطق الإدخال والإخراج يمنع التداخل ويقلل الأخطاء.2. تخصيص المناطق (Zoning):كل نوع مخزون له طبيعة معينة:المواد السريعة الحركة (Fast-Moving) توضع قرب مناطق الشحن.المواد الثقيلة تحتاج مناطق أرضية وقريبة من ممرات الرافعات.الأصناف الراكدة تخزن في أماكن بعيدة لتوفير المساحة.3. الكثافة التخزينية مقابل الوصول السريع (Storage Density vs. Accessibility):الأنظمة عالية الكثافة (مثل Drive-In أو Push Back) بتوفر مساحة، لكن تقلل سرعة الوصول.أنظمة الرفوف المفتوحة (Selective Racking) أسرع في الوصول، لكنها تستهلك مساحة أكبر.التوازن هنا مهم حسب طبيعة الأصناف وحجم الطلب.4. مرونة التوسع والتعديل:لازم التصميم يسمح بإعادة ترتيب الأقسام بسهولة حسب تغير طبيعة التشغيل أو حجم المخزون.تركيب أنظمة رفوف قابلة للتعديل بيتيح إعادة التنظيم بدون تكاليف كبيرة.5. دمج التكنولوجيا في التصميم:لو بتخطط تستخدم WMS أو أنظمة تتبع بالأكواد (Barcode/RFID)، لازم التصميم يدعم:نقاط مسح عند كل مرحلة.مناطق شحن واستلام مهيأة للقراءة السريعة والدقة العالية.خلاصة:التصميم مش مرحلة لمرة واحدة... ده عنصر مستمر بيتطور مع تغير نوعية المخزون، حجم الطلب، وطبيعة التشغيل.التصميم الجيد يقلل الزمن الضائع، يقلل الحوادث، يزيد الدقة، ويخلي التشغيل مرن وسلس.هل سبق لك شاركت في إعادة تصميم أو تطوير مخزن؟شاركني بأفكارك أو التحديات اللي واجهتها!hashtag#WarehouseDesign hashtag#WarehouseEfficiency hashtag#LogisticsOptimization hashtag#SupplyChainManagement hashtag#LeanWarehouse hashtag#AliAdel hashtag#إدارة_المخازن

Абылкайырхан СарсетаевАбылкайырхан Сарсетаев,,"🚗🔌 Implementing BLE for Car Connectivity in Android 🔌🚗I'm excited to share a feature I've recently implemented in Jetem app, where I integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect and communicate with a vehicle. The core of the functionality allows the app to: • Discover the car: Using BLE scanning, I can find the car's Bluetooth device. • Connect: Once the car is found, the app establishes a connection via Bluetooth GATT. • Send Commands: After the connection, I can send commands such as open or close the car doors, which are transmitted securely using BLE.Here’s an overview of how it works:1. BLE Scanning: The app scans for nearby Bluetooth devices, specifically targeting the car’s Bluetooth signal.2. Connection: Upon finding the target device, it initiates the GATT connection.3. Command Handling: Once connected, commands like ""auth"", ""open door"" or ""close door"" are sent and executed via Bluetooth characteristics and descriptors.4. Real-time Updates: The app listens for notifications from the car, ensuring actions are performed successfully and feedback is received promptly.

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

Sagarika BasuSagarika Basu,,"“Are you even working if you’re not commuting 2 hours a day and eating sad sandwiches in meetings that could’ve been emails?” 😒That used to be the unspoken (and sometimes spoken) rule in the corporate world.So….Let’s rewind a bit!A few years ago, I was deep in the 9-to-5 grind. I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust.

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Vikram SVikram S,,"Title: Java Program to Analyze Student MarksIntroduction:This Java program is designed to assist in analyzing student performance by collecting marks for a fixed set of subjects and then computing useful insights such as the total marks, average, highest and lowest marks, and the corresponding subjects.Functionality Overview:The program begins by prompting the user to enter marks for a predefined list of subjects: Tamil, English, Maths, Science, and Social. The marks entered by the user are stored in an integer array.Core Processing:Once the marks are collected, the program performs the following tasks:1. Total Marks Calculation: It adds up all the marks using a loop.2. Average Marks: The total is divided by the number of subjects to get the average.3. Identifying Extremes: It finds the highest and lowest marks by comparing each subject's score. Along with the marks, the program also tracks which subjects have these scores.Output:After processing the data, the program displays:Total marksAverage marksThe subject with the highest marksThe subject with the lowest marksConclusion:This program is a simple yet effective example of how arrays, loops, and conditionals can be used in Java to manage and analyze student data. It helps reinforce key programming concepts while being practical for real-world applications like report card generation.hashtag#snsinstitutions hashtag#snsdesignthikers hashtag#designthinking

ALI ADELALI ADEL,,"هل تصميم المخزن عندك بيخدم التشغيل... ولا بيعطّله؟في المخازن، مش بس المعدات أو النظام اللي بيأثر على الكفاءة... تصميم المخزن نفسه ممكن يكون هو الفارق بين التشغيل السلس والتكدس والعشوائية!من خلال خبرتي في مجال قطع الغيار والمخازن، لاحظت إن في 5 عناصر تصميم أساسية بتحدد نجاح أو فشل أي مخزن:1. تخطيط تدفق العمل (Flow Design):تصميم المسارات يبدأ من الاستلام (Receiving) مرورًا بالتخزين (Putaway) وانتهاء بالتجهيز (Picking) والشحن (Dispatch).كل خطوة لازم تكون مترابطة بمسار واضح لتقليل الحركة العشوائية.الفصل بين مناطق الإدخال والإخراج يمنع التداخل ويقلل الأخطاء.2. تخصيص المناطق (Zoning):كل نوع مخزون له طبيعة معينة:المواد السريعة الحركة (Fast-Moving) توضع قرب مناطق الشحن.المواد الثقيلة تحتاج مناطق أرضية وقريبة من ممرات الرافعات.الأصناف الراكدة تخزن في أماكن بعيدة لتوفير المساحة.3. الكثافة التخزينية مقابل الوصول السريع (Storage Density vs. Accessibility):الأنظمة عالية الكثافة (مثل Drive-In أو Push Back) بتوفر مساحة، لكن تقلل سرعة الوصول.أنظمة الرفوف المفتوحة (Selective Racking) أسرع في الوصول، لكنها تستهلك مساحة أكبر.التوازن هنا مهم حسب طبيعة الأصناف وحجم الطلب.4. مرونة التوسع والتعديل:لازم التصميم يسمح بإعادة ترتيب الأقسام بسهولة حسب تغير طبيعة التشغيل أو حجم المخزون.تركيب أنظمة رفوف قابلة للتعديل بيتيح إعادة التنظيم بدون تكاليف كبيرة.5. دمج التكنولوجيا في التصميم:لو بتخطط تستخدم WMS أو أنظمة تتبع بالأكواد (Barcode/RFID)، لازم التصميم يدعم:نقاط مسح عند كل مرحلة.مناطق شحن واستلام مهيأة للقراءة السريعة والدقة العالية.خلاصة:التصميم مش مرحلة لمرة واحدة... ده عنصر مستمر بيتطور مع تغير نوعية المخزون، حجم الطلب، وطبيعة التشغيل.التصميم الجيد يقلل الزمن الضائع، يقلل الحوادث، يزيد الدقة، ويخلي التشغيل مرن وسلس.هل سبق لك شاركت في إعادة تصميم أو تطوير مخزن؟شاركني بأفكارك أو التحديات اللي واجهتها!hashtag#WarehouseDesign hashtag#WarehouseEfficiency hashtag#LogisticsOptimization hashtag#SupplyChainManagement hashtag#LeanWarehouse hashtag#AliAdel hashtag#إدارة_المخازن

Абылкайырхан СарсетаевАбылкайырхан Сарсетаев,,"🚗🔌 Implementing BLE for Car Connectivity in Android 🔌🚗I'm excited to share a feature I've recently implemented in Jetem app, where I integrated Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect and communicate with a vehicle. The core of the functionality allows the app to: • Discover the car: Using BLE scanning, I can find the car's Bluetooth device. • Connect: Once the car is found, the app establishes a connection via Bluetooth GATT. • Send Commands: After the connection, I can send commands such as open or close the car doors, which are transmitted securely using BLE.Here’s an overview of how it works:1. BLE Scanning: The app scans for nearby Bluetooth devices, specifically targeting the car’s Bluetooth signal.2. Connection: Upon finding the target device, it initiates the GATT connection.3. Command Handling: Once connected, commands like ""auth"", ""open door"" or ""close door"" are sent and executed via Bluetooth characteristics and descriptors.4. Real-time Updates: The app listens for notifications from the car, ensuring actions are performed successfully and feedback is received promptly.

I believe it’s here to stay (and thanks to Prithwiraj Choudhury for backing that up with some excellent data on the call yesterday. Really interesting stuff.)💡 If you're saving money by ditching your office lease - amazing. But don’t pocket all of it. Taking a slice of that budget and reinvesting it into bringing your team together  - is ROI positive.💎 Because in-person time? It still matters - a lot. Not just for productivity, but for idea flow, culture-building, mentorship, and those unplanned “wait, you’re stuck on that too?” moments.The real question is: If you're running a remote company, how do you make your in-person time count?🚀 At RocketReach, here's what we aim for:🔹 Monthly: Our NYC-based folks co-work together 1x a month.🔹Semiannually: Each team gets an offsite-style work week to connect, reset, and plan.🔹Hackathons: 2x a year for Product + Eng to let creativity take the lead.🔹Annually: A full-team retreat to bond, celebrate, and actually have fun together.Remote ≠ disconnected. You just have to be intentional.Curious - what’s worked for you when it comes to remote + in-person rhythm?hashtag#remotework hashtag#leadership hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#startupops

Kirti DubeyKirti Dubey,,"IN-OFFICE  vs  REMOTE LEGAL INTERNSHIPSYou applied for a virtual remote internship. You got selected.You updated your LinkedIn.But wait… Is a remote legal internship actually worth it?Will recruiters value it?Will you learn real skills?Orwill you just become an email-forwarding intern?Here's the verdict:1⃣ Learning curve: Hands-on work vs. Screen work📍 In-office internship = Real-world exposure. You watch senior lawyers argue in court, draft real contracts, and interact with clients. 📍 Remote internship = Good for research & drafting. But you miss out on the action. No court visits, no last-minute client calls.✅ Example: A litigation intern working in an office learns court procedures.A remote intern?They research case laws but never see them argued in real time.💡If you want practical legal skills, in-office wins. If you love research & writing, remote works.2⃣ Networking: Coffee chats vs. Cold Emails📍 In-office internship = You interact with seniors, learn from casual conversations, and build real relationships. 📍 Remote internship = You connect via emails & Zoom.It’s harder to make a lasting impression.✅ Example: An intern at a corporate firm grabs coffee with a partner, gets career advice, and later, a job referral.A remote intern?Sends a “Thank you for the opportunity” email and gets… seen-zoned.💡 Want strong industry connections? In-office internships are gold.3⃣ Work-life balance: Hustle vs. Flexibility📍 In-office internship = Fixed schedule. Long hours. Commuting stress. 📍 Remote internship = Work from anywhere. More control over time.✅ Example: A remote intern can attend classes and work at night. An in-office intern?Running from courtrooms to college like a legal Usain Bolt.💡 If you need flexibility, remote internships win. If you want the real law firm experience, in-office is unbeatable.4⃣ CV value: ""Interned"" vs. ""Actually worked""📍 In-office internships = More credibility. Lawyers trust work done in a law firm setting. 📍 Remote internships = Skeptical recruiters.Did you really work, or just edit PDFs?✅ Example: A hiring partner sees two CVs:One intern worked physically in a top-tier firm.One intern remotely with a legal blog.Who gets the callback?You know the answer. 😉💡 Want a CV that stands out? In-office internships have more weight.5⃣ Which one teaches you more? 📍Remote internships are great for research, writing, and learning at your own pace. 📍 In-office internships teach real legal work—drafting, client handling, and actual practice.✅ Example:A litigation intern in court learns how judges react to arguments.A remote intern reads judgments but never sees them applied.💡 If you want to become a lawyer, in-office internships will teach you more.🎯 Final advice?📌 If you’re in 1st or 2nd year, remote internships help build skills. 📌 If you’re in 3rd year or beyond, prioritize in-office internships.Real exposure > Virtual learning.hashtag#law

I had the desk. The ID Card. The Friday pizza parties. The “you’re on mute” calls.But also—the burnout, the lack of flexibility, and the quiet dread of Monday mornings.Remote work? That was considered a “perk,” not a viable lifestyle.It was the forbidden fruit in the orchard of productivity myths.So, I did something wild…I quit.🙃First, I dipped my toes into freelancing—scary but liberating. Then, I cannonballed into starting my own business!SynapseITSolutions !No map. Just Wi-Fi and willpower.Suddenly, I wasn’t just working remotely…I WAS LIVING INTENTIONALLY!I had control.I picked my hours, my clients, my chai breaks. I replaced commutes with creativity, and burnout with balance.And guess what?I didn’t just survive—I thrived. 😇Now here’s the kicker: the same companies that once side-eyed remote work?They’re embracing it.They’ve seen the numbers. The productivity. The morale boost. The talent retention.Turns out, trusting your team actually works. Who knew? 😉One of my favorite moments was when a former manager messaged me:“I used to think remote workers were just watching Netflix all day. Now I’m one of them—and I’ve never been more productive.”Look, remote vs hybrid vs in-office isn’t a one-size-fits-all debate.But it is about choice. Autonomy. Trust. And reimagining what work can look like!To everyone who’s made the leap, is dreaming of it, or just questioning the status quo—you’re not alone.Because work shouldn’t be a place….It should be a feeling!😇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#EntrepreneurLife hashtag#FreelanceLife hashtag#StartUpLife

Janaki SubramaniJanaki Subramani,,"🚀 Day 04 of my hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA challenge! 🚀1)Today I tackled a parallel partial-sum (inclusive scan) kernel on the GPU:Summed two input elements per thread (input[idx] + input[idx+blockDim.x]) into shared memory for coalesced loads.2)Added guarded-load logic so threads past the array end read zero, avoiding out-of-bounds errors.3) Laid out a tree-based inclusive scan in shared memory, doing O(log blockSize) strides with __syncthreads() for each step.4) Computed gridSize = (N + 2*blockSize – 1)/(2*blockSize) so every element is processed when each block handles 2×blockSize inputs.5)Wrapped all CUDA API calls in a CUDA_CHECK macro to catch and report errors immediately.🔹 Key takeawaysIn-place prefix sum: Implemented a scalable tree-based scan pattern in shared memory.Memory coalescing: Two-element threads maximize bandwidth by loading contiguous data.Bounds safety: Guarded-load idioms ensure correctness when N isn’t a multiple of 2×blockSize.Grid-block sizing: 2 elements per thread halves the number of required blocks, improving occupancy.📂 Check out the code and follow along: 👉 https://lnkd.in/dwkvia42Would love your feedback: 💬 Any tips for further optimizing scan kernels? 👍 Drop a like if you enjoy these daily deep dives!hashtag#CUDA hashtag#GPUProgramming hashtag#ParallelComputing hashtag#PrefixSum hashtag#SharedMemory hashtag#PMPP hashtag#100DaysOfCUDA

David PortilloDavid Portillo,,"As a student entering the tech industry, I’ve witnessed the growing permanence of remote software engineering. What started as a pandemic workaround has evolved into a powerful model for productivity, collaboration, and inclusion.A recent GitLab Remote Work Report (2023) revealed that 86% of developers feel more productive working remotely, and 80% prefer it to in-office setups. For students, these numbers aren’t just stats—they represent opportunity. Remote work is giving us access to real-world experiences we wouldn’t otherwise have.One of my most meaningful remote experiences was developing a Unix-style shell in C, called atlas-simple_shell. This wasn’t a tutorial project—it was a fully functional command-line interpreter with features like piping, error handling, and environment variable management.What made this experience powerful wasn’t just the code—it was how my team and I collaborated. All of us were based in the same city, but none of us worked in the same place. Some preferred early mornings at the library, others coded from home or cafés late into the night. Remote work let each of us stay in our flow and schedule.We used GitHub to manage version control and pull requests, and met via Zoom when syncs were needed. Our coordination through Slack meant we could keep momentum without waiting on each other. This asynchronous setup didn’t just help the project succeed—it taught us to communicate, document, and organize like professionals.Remote collaboration doesn’t lower expectations—it raises them. Working asynchronously demands better communication, ownership, and planning. Here’s what remote professionalism meant for me:Clear Communication: Writing clean, detailed pull request messages and updates.Accountability: Sticking to deadlines, even if we weren’t being directly managed.Technical Documentation: Creating READMEs and code comments that made the project usable and understandable for everyone on the team.Collaboration Without Co-location: Knowing when to push forward independently vs. when to sync with teammates.These habits are exactly what top engineering teams need, whether remote or not.Remote software engineering has changed how students like me access experience and build skills. I didn’t need a physical internship to practice real collaboration. I learned how to handle source control in a team, maintain project structure, and debug others’ code.Even more exciting is how inclusive this model is. When location is no longer a constraint, more people can participate. Students from different backgrounds, responsibilities, and living situations can still contribute—and thrive.Remote work helped me work smarter, stay motivated, and build something meaningful with others on my own terms. It’s a practice I’m taking into the professional world with confidence.SourcesGitLab Remote Work Report 2023 – GitLabStack Overflow Blog – How Remote Engineering Teams Can Succeed

Moustafa MowaffakMoustafa Mowaffak,,"Some thoughts on hashtag#remoteWorkI don’t think I need to explain how remote work has evolved in recent years. Before COVID-19 (pre-2021), remote work was a rare privilege—something only a lucky few could negotiate. But during the pandemic, it became the norm, especially in computer-based fields like software engineering, analytics, and marketing.Over the past few months, however, we've seen increasing pushback. Some companies have gone as far as mandating a full return to the office—not just hybrid, but five days a week. I wanted to reflect on what feels like a regression.I call it a regression because, had it not been for a global pandemic, many companies would still believe that productivity could only be guaranteed through physical presence—by clocking in and out, sitting at a desk under watchful eyes. But we proved otherwise. Productivity didn’t tank. The world didn’t stop. The sun didn’t rise from the west.That said, remote work wasn’t without its challenges. Some individuals abused the flexibility—juggling multiple full-time roles at once and damaging the trust-based relationship needed for remote work to thrive.I’ve also noticed that some recent graduates, who entered the workforce in this new remote-first world, struggled with engagement. Thrust into what felt like a dream scenario, some lacked the structure or mentorship that in-person environments naturally provide—leading to performance issues.But let’s not allow a few bad examples to overshadow the bigger picture. Remote work may be one of the greatest professional shifts of our time. At least for me, here’s what it’s meant:1.  I gained back over 2 hours a day from commuting—that’s 700 hours a year. Less commuting = less stress and wasted energy = more productivity.2. That’s time I now spend with my family, myself—or yes, sometimes, even working.3. Most importantly, I got to watch my baby girl grow up. Every day. From the moment she was born until now, two years later, I’ve seen her in her element. That’s priceless. It’s something many of our fathers missed—and I don’t think we should repeat that mistake.4. I have more control over my timSo how do we make remote work a win-win?1. Trust, but verify: Build accountability through regular check-ins, clear deliverables, and performance metrics.2. Hybrid mentorship: Pair remote flexibility with in-person or virtual mentorship to support junior talent.3. Cultural investment: Create intentional moments for team bonding and alignment—digitally or otherwise.4. Results over hours: Focus on outcomes, not desk time. Empower employees to own their time.Remote work isn’t perfect—but neither was the old way. Let’s not lose sight of the enormous good it can bring, when done right. I’m genuinely grateful to Klarna for embracing this culture—striking a healthy balance between drive and productivity, while honoring the importance of family and well-being. Let’s evolve, not revert.hashtag#remotework hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#productivity

Tripti SinghTripti Singh,,"🚀 Day 11 of my 30 Days Java & DSA Challenge 🎯 Topic: Compile-Time Polymorphism in Java (Method Overloading)Today, I explored one of the foundational OOP concepts in Java—Polymorphism, specifically Method Overloading. It’s all about writing multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types or orders. 💡✅ What's happening here?In my Calculators class, the add() method is overloaded in 5 ways:add(int, int)add(float, float)add(double, double)add(int, float)add(float, int)Each method prints the exact combination of arguments it's invoked with—clearly demonstrating how Java determines which method to run at compile time based on argument types. This is Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism.🧪 Test Results (from the code):c.add(10, 20);           // int-intc.add(10.5f, 20.5f);     // float-floatc.add(10.5, 20.5);       // double-doublec.add(10, 20.5f);        // int-floatc.add(10.5f, 20);        // float-intGrateful to mentors like Syed Zabi Ulla Sir and Raghav Garg Sir for the constant motivation. 🙏hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP hashtag#Polymorphism hashtag#MethodOverloading hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#DSA hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#30DaysOfCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#CompileTimePolymorphism hashtag#LinkedInLearning

Raja GuptaRaja Gupta,,"If you're starting with STM32 Nucleo board with HAL...Most tutorials on YouTube recommend using STM32CubeMX’s graphical interface. It’s beginner-friendly, no doubt. But if you want to understand things deeper by writing code manually, here’s something important you should know.# My Experience & What Went WrongI was following a tutorial where the instructor used the graphical interface just once—only for initial project setup so that CubeMX brings in the necessary HAL libraries. After that, all the coding was done manually.While following the steps:1. I deleted some core files as shown in the video (I’ve marked them in the image below).2. I wrote a basic LED blink code to test using HAL and used a for-loop based delay, which worked fine but using loops for delay isn’t good practice.3. So I replaced that with HAL_Delay()—and the LED stopped blinking. It just stayed ON all the time.( PS: When using HAL_Delay(), you need to setup first SystemClock. By default cubemx also generate that code initially during project creation, you can use same. )Tried everything—debugging, checking RCC and SysTick—nothing worked.Finally, I created a new project, this time:Only wrote my custom code inside main.cDidn’t delete any CubeMX-generated filesAnd guess what? It worked perfectly.# Lesson LearnedLet CubeMX generate the base project once. Don’t delete anything from it—even if it looks useless.Those files are important. Some of them handle startup, clocks, SysTick, and even interrupt vectors behind the scenes.# Step-by-Step: Creating a Manual HAL Project (Without CubeMX)1. Create a new STM32 project in STM32CubeIDE→ Select your MCU (e.g., STM32F446RE)2. Once the CubeMX window opens, go to Pinout view and click “Clear Pinout”→ This gives you a minimal project with boilerplate code and necessary HAL setup3. Open main.c and remove the default logic→ Start writing your own code manually→ But make sure you don’t go back to CubeMX after that, or it will overwrite your changes4. If you plan to use both graphical + manual setup, use the same main.c and only write code inside these safe blocks:/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */// your code/* USER CODE END 0 */CubeMX will leave your code untouched inside these markers.Follow me on LinkedIn for more tips: https://lnkd.in/drr2xUDjhashtag#stm32 hashtag#microcontrollers hashtag#embedded hashtag#hal hashtag#cmsis hashtag#lowlevelprogramming hashtag#stm32cubeide hashtag#baremetal hashtag#driverdevelopment hashtag#embeddedengineering hashtag#nucleo

Muhammad MudassirMuhammad Mudassir,,"💡 Ever wondered how Java manages memory so efficiently when dealing with strings? Let’s dive into the concept of the Java String Pool and uncover its significance. 🚀🧵 What is the Java String Pool?The Java String Pool is a special area in the heap memory 🧠 where Java stores string literals. When you create a string literal, Java checks the pool to see if an identical string already exists. If it does, Java reuses the reference, saving memory and improving performance. This process is called string interning 🔁.💎 Why is it Important?🔹 Memory Optimization: Reuses immutable string objects to reduce   memory overhead. 🔹 Performance Enhancement: Less memory usage = faster garbage collection 🧹 and smoother app performance ⚡. 🔹 Consistency: Identical string literals share the same reference, ensuring consistency across the application. ✔️ String a = ""Java""; String b = ""Java""; System.out.println(a == b); // Outputs: true ✅📌 Key Takeaway:Understanding the String Pool helps you write memory-efficient Java applications 💼. It's a subtle yet powerful feature that underscores Java’s design for performance and reliability. 🛠️hashtag#Java hashtag#StringPool hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaMemory hashtag#JavaOptimization hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#MemoryManagement

Felipe CardosoFelipe Cardoso,,"As a student still preparing for object-oriented programming 🛠️, I recognize that my perspective may not fully capture the complexities of professional development.However, my initial foray into Java and C# revealed a fundamental difference in understanding the basic concepts. Java’s often-criticized verbosity surprisingly served as a more transparent guide, encouraging a deeper understanding of the inner workings of OOP.On the other hand, C#’s elegance and conciseness, while appealing for cleaner code, occasionally obscured crucial details that Java’s explicitness reveals. This raises a fundamental question for fellow learners: to what extent can syntactic abstraction, while increasing the productivity of experienced developers, make it difficult for beginners to internalize fundamental principles? As insightfully discussed in Forrest Knight video, Java’s verbosity and apparent clutter can indeed be an initial obstacle for beginners.Despite the undeniable market forces that influence the adoption of these languages, my initial experience tends to value an approach that advocates conceptual transparency, even if that means more verbose syntax. I deeply admire Forrest Knight's work!🙏 I believe that the detailed clarity inherent in Java has fostered a more robust and fundamental learning journey.hashtag#Java hashtag#OOP #C#

Franco PereyraFranco Pereyra,,"Global remote workers get paid less than Americans for the same job... And that's OK.As someone living in Buenos Aires, I get why that rubs some people the wrong way.But here’s the reality: the local job market just doesn’t compare.A friend of mine is a middle manager at one of the biggest banks here. Fifteen years of experience, leadership role, and he makes $2,500 a month.Meanwhile, someone with a few years of marketing experience working remotely can earn more than that.So yeah, we’re doing the same work for less money than our US counterparts.But we’re also living in countries with lower costs, closer to family, and with access to opportunities we wouldn’t have had otherwise.Some people hear this and immediately jump to “exploitation.” And don’t get me wrong — there are companies out there taking advantage.But paying less isn’t automatically a bad thing.It’s a reflection of different economies, not different levels of respect.Hopefully, wages in countries like mine will rise as our economies grow. But in the meantime, global remote work gives people here a way to level up their lives.That’s a win in my book.

Vikram SVikram S,,"Title: Java Program to Analyze Student MarksIntroduction:This Java program is designed to assist in analyzing student performance by collecting marks for a fixed set of subjects and then computing useful insights such as the total marks, average, highest and lowest marks, and the corresponding subjects.Functionality Overview:The program begins by prompting the user to enter marks for a predefined list of subjects: Tamil, English, Maths, Science, and Social. The marks entered by the user are stored in an integer array.Core Processing:Once the marks are collected, the program performs the following tasks:1. Total Marks Calculation: It adds up all the marks using a loop.2. Average Marks: The total is divided by the number of subjects to get the average.3. Identifying Extremes: It finds the highest and lowest marks by comparing each subject's score. Along with the marks, the program also tracks which subjects have these scores.Output:After processing the data, the program displays:Total marksAverage marksThe subject with the highest marksThe subject with the lowest marksConclusion:This program is a simple yet effective example of how arrays, loops, and conditionals can be used in Java to manage and analyze student data. It helps reinforce key programming concepts while being practical for real-world applications like report card generation.hashtag#snsinstitutions hashtag#snsdesignthikers hashtag#designthinking

ALI ADELALI ADEL,,"هل تصميم المخزن عندك بيخدم التشغيل... ولا بيعطّله؟في المخازن، مش بس المعدات أو النظام اللي بيأثر على الكفاءة... تصميم المخزن نفسه ممكن يكون هو الفارق بين التشغيل السلس والتكدس والعشوائية!من خلال خبرتي في مجال قطع الغيار والمخازن، لاحظت إن في 5 عناصر تصميم أساسية بتحدد نجاح أو فشل أي مخزن:1. تخطيط تدفق العمل (Flow Design):تصميم المسارات يبدأ من الاستلام (Receiving) مرورًا بالتخزين (Putaway) وانتهاء بالتجهيز (Picking) والشحن (Dispatch).كل خطوة لازم تكون مترابطة بمسار واضح لتقليل الحركة العشوائية.الفصل بين مناطق الإدخال والإخراج يمنع التداخل ويقلل الأخطاء.2. تخصيص المناطق (Zoning):كل نوع مخزون له طبيعة معينة:المواد السريعة الحركة (Fast-Moving) توضع قرب مناطق الشحن.المواد الثقيلة تحتاج مناطق أرضية وقريبة من ممرات الرافعات.الأصناف الراكدة تخزن في أماكن بعيدة لتوفير المساحة.3. الكثافة التخزينية مقابل الوصول السريع (Storage Density vs. Accessibility):الأنظمة عالية الكثافة (مثل Drive-In أو Push Back) بتوفر مساحة، لكن تقلل سرعة الوصول.أنظمة الرفوف المفتوحة (Selective Racking) أسرع في الوصول، لكنها تستهلك مساحة أكبر.التوازن هنا مهم حسب طبيعة الأصناف وحجم الطلب.4. مرونة التوسع والتعديل:لازم التصميم يسمح بإعادة ترتيب الأقسام بسهولة حسب تغير طبيعة التشغيل أو حجم المخزون.تركيب أنظمة رفوف قابلة للتعديل بيتيح إعادة التنظيم بدون تكاليف كبيرة.5. دمج التكنولوجيا في التصميم:لو بتخطط تستخدم WMS أو أنظمة تتبع بالأكواد (Barcode/RFID)، لازم التصميم يدعم:نقاط مسح عند كل مرحلة.مناطق شحن واستلام مهيأة للقراءة السريعة والدقة العالية.خلاصة:التصميم مش مرحلة لمرة واحدة... ده عنصر مستمر بيتطور مع تغير نوعية المخزون، حجم الطلب، وطبيعة التشغيل.التصميم الجيد يقلل الزمن الضائع، يقلل الحوادث، يزيد الدقة، ويخلي التشغيل مرن وسلس.هل سبق لك شاركت في إعادة تصميم أو تطوير مخزن؟شاركني بأفكارك أو التحديات اللي واجهتها!hashtag#WarehouseDesign hashtag#WarehouseEfficiency hashtag#LogisticsOptimization hashtag#SupplyChainManagement hashtag#LeanWarehouse hashtag#AliAdel hashtag#إدارة_المخازن

The core of the functionality allows the app to: • Discover the car: Using BLE scanning, I can find the car's Bluetooth device. • Connect: Once the car is found, the app establishes a connection via Bluetooth GATT. • Send Commands: After the connection, I can send commands such as open or close the car doors, which are transmitted securely using BLE.Here’s an overview of how it works:1. BLE Scanning: The app scans for nearby Bluetooth devices, specifically targeting the car’s Bluetooth signal.2. Connection: Upon finding the target device, it initiates the GATT connection.3. Command Handling: Once connected, commands like ""auth"", ""open door"" or ""close door"" are sent and executed via Bluetooth characteristics and descriptors.4. Real-time Updates: The app listens for notifications from the car, ensuring actions are performed successfully and feedback is received promptly.

It happens in the middle of the day, in waiting rooms, and at 3 a.m. It doesn’t ask for permission. Or fit in a calendar.For caregivers, flexible work isn’t about convenience —It’s about survival.At Remote Ones, we help companies build remote-first teams that make space for real life.Because the best people won’t always be the most available. They’re the most resilient, committed, and quietly carrying more than you’ll ever know.If your workplace only works for people with nothing else going on — It’s time to rethink what you’re building.hashtag#RemoteOnes hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Caregiving hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#PeopleFirst hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CompassionAtWork hashtag#RemoteFirst hashtag#TrustAndFlexibility

Julia KimmelJulia Kimmel,,"🌎 As you probably guessed - I’ve embraced work from anywhere. I believe it’s here to stay (and thanks to Prithwiraj Choudhury for backing that up with some excellent data on the call yesterday. Really interesting stuff.)💡 If you're saving money by ditching your office lease - amazing. But don’t pocket all of it. Taking a slice of that budget and reinvesting it into bringing your team together  - is ROI positive.💎 Because in-person time? It still matters - a lot. Not just for productivity, but for idea flow, culture-building, mentorship, and those unplanned “wait, you’re stuck on that too?” moments.The real question is: If you're running a remote company, how do you make your in-person time count?🚀 At RocketReach, here's what we aim for:🔹 Monthly: Our NYC-based folks co-work together 1x a month.🔹Semiannually: Each team gets an offsite-style work week to connect, reset, and plan.🔹Hackathons: 2x a year for Product + Eng to let creativity take the lead.🔹Annually: A full-team retreat to bond, celebrate, and actually have fun together.Remote ≠ disconnected. You just have to be intentional.Curious - what’s worked for you when it comes to remote + in-person rhythm?hashtag#remotework hashtag#leadership hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#futureofwork hashtag#startupops
