mahesh laggalamahesh laggala,,"🚀 Looking for DevOps Engineer role 🙂 🚀 CI/CD Automation with Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus & Tomcat🔧 Tech Stack: Jenkins | GitHub | SonarQube | Nexus | Apache TomcatAs part of my DevOps journey, I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that automates the entire process from code integration to deployment. Here's a breakdown of the project:🔹 GitHub Integration – The pipeline is triggered automatically when code is pushed to a GitHub repository.🔹 Continuous Integration with Jenkins – Jenkins orchestrates the CI/CD process, building and testing the application on every code commit.🔹 Code Quality Analysis – Integrated SonarQube into the pipeline for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and identifying bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.🔹 Artifact Management – Leveraged Nexus Repository Manager to store and manage build artifacts securely.🔹 Deployment – Automated deployment of the final build to an Apache Tomcat server, enabling continuous delivery of updates.📈 Impact: This setup reduced manual interventions, ensured higher code quality, and accelerated the release cycle.Jenkins Pipeline 👇 :pipeline { agent any  stages { stage('checkout') { steps { checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://lnkd.in/gTq2KHZm']]) } } stage('validate') { steps { sh 'mvn validate' } } stage('compile') { steps { sh 'mvn compile' } } stage('test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } } stage('package') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } } stage('sonarqube') { steps { sh '''mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=train-ticket-reservation -Dsonar.projectName='train-ticket-reservation' -Dsonar.host.url=http://3.81.86.77:9000 -Dsonar.token=sqp_f49c90c472aec1b8ab45bbe0fea275eb392401d8''' } } stage('Nexus') { steps { nexusArtifactUploader artifacts: [[artifactId: 'TrainBook', classifier: '', file: '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Project/target/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war', type: 'war']], credentialsId: '51f559bc-8d05-4ffe-817b-5616ae857508', groupId: 'TrainBook', nexusUrl: '3.81.86.77', nexusVersion: 'nexus3', protocol: 'http', repository: 'maven-snapshots', version: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'  } }  stage('deploy to tomcat'){ steps{ deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat', path: '', url: 'http://3.81.86.77:8080/')], contextPath: null, onFailure: false, war: '/*.war' } } }}hashtag#Devops hashtag#jenkins hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#AWSDevOps hashtag#Git hashtag#GitHub hashtag#SoanrQube hashtag#Nexus hashtag#Tomcat hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#AwsDevOpsrole hashtag#DevopsEngineerrole hashtag#AWS hashtag#Recuirters

mahesh laggalamahesh laggala,,"🚀 Looking for DevOps Engineer role 🙂 🚀 CI/CD Automation with Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus & Tomcat🔧 Tech Stack: Jenkins | GitHub | SonarQube | Nexus | Apache TomcatAs part of my DevOps journey, I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that automates the entire process from code integration to deployment. Here's a breakdown of the project:🔹 GitHub Integration – The pipeline is triggered automatically when code is pushed to a GitHub repository.🔹 Continuous Integration with Jenkins – Jenkins orchestrates the CI/CD process, building and testing the application on every code commit.🔹 Code Quality Analysis – Integrated SonarQube into the pipeline for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and identifying bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.🔹 Artifact Management – Leveraged Nexus Repository Manager to store and manage build artifacts securely.🔹 Deployment – Automated deployment of the final build to an Apache Tomcat server, enabling continuous delivery of updates.📈 Impact: This setup reduced manual interventions, ensured higher code quality, and accelerated the release cycle.Jenkins Pipeline 👇 :pipeline { agent any  stages { stage('checkout') { steps { checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://lnkd.in/gTq2KHZm']]) } } stage('validate') { steps { sh 'mvn validate' } } stage('compile') { steps { sh 'mvn compile' } } stage('test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } } stage('package') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } } stage('sonarqube') { steps { sh '''mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=train-ticket-reservation -Dsonar.projectName='train-ticket-reservation' -Dsonar.host.url=http://3.81.86.77:9000 -Dsonar.token=sqp_f49c90c472aec1b8ab45bbe0fea275eb392401d8''' } } stage('Nexus') { steps { nexusArtifactUploader artifacts: [[artifactId: 'TrainBook', classifier: '', file: '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Project/target/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war', type: 'war']], credentialsId: '51f559bc-8d05-4ffe-817b-5616ae857508', groupId: 'TrainBook', nexusUrl: '3.81.86.77', nexusVersion: 'nexus3', protocol: 'http', repository: 'maven-snapshots', version: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'  } }  stage('deploy to tomcat'){ steps{ deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat', path: '', url: 'http://3.81.86.77:8080/')], contextPath: null, onFailure: false, war: '/*.war' } } }}hashtag#Devops hashtag#jenkins hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#AWSDevOps hashtag#Git hashtag#GitHub hashtag#SoanrQube hashtag#Nexus hashtag#Tomcat hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#AwsDevOpsrole hashtag#DevopsEngineerrole hashtag#AWS hashtag#Recuirters

mahesh laggalamahesh laggala,,"🚀 Looking for DevOps Engineer role 🙂 🚀 CI/CD Automation with Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus & Tomcat🔧 Tech Stack: Jenkins | GitHub | SonarQube | Nexus | Apache TomcatAs part of my DevOps journey, I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that automates the entire process from code integration to deployment. Here's a breakdown of the project:🔹 GitHub Integration – The pipeline is triggered automatically when code is pushed to a GitHub repository.🔹 Continuous Integration with Jenkins – Jenkins orchestrates the CI/CD process, building and testing the application on every code commit.🔹 Code Quality Analysis – Integrated SonarQube into the pipeline for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and identifying bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.🔹 Artifact Management – Leveraged Nexus Repository Manager to store and manage build artifacts securely.🔹 Deployment – Automated deployment of the final build to an Apache Tomcat server, enabling continuous delivery of updates.📈 Impact: This setup reduced manual interventions, ensured higher code quality, and accelerated the release cycle.Jenkins Pipeline 👇 :pipeline { agent any  stages { stage('checkout') { steps { checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://lnkd.in/gTq2KHZm']]) } } stage('validate') { steps { sh 'mvn validate' } } stage('compile') { steps { sh 'mvn compile' } } stage('test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } } stage('package') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } } stage('sonarqube') { steps { sh '''mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=train-ticket-reservation -Dsonar.projectName='train-ticket-reservation' -Dsonar.host.url=http://3.81.86.77:9000 -Dsonar.token=sqp_f49c90c472aec1b8ab45bbe0fea275eb392401d8''' } } stage('Nexus') { steps { nexusArtifactUploader artifacts: [[artifactId: 'TrainBook', classifier: '', file: '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Project/target/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war', type: 'war']], credentialsId: '51f559bc-8d05-4ffe-817b-5616ae857508', groupId: 'TrainBook', nexusUrl: '3.81.86.77', nexusVersion: 'nexus3', protocol: 'http', repository: 'maven-snapshots', version: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'  } }  stage('deploy to tomcat'){ steps{ deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat', path: '', url: 'http://3.81.86.77:8080/')], contextPath: null, onFailure: false, war: '/*.war' } } }}hashtag#Devops hashtag#jenkins hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#AWSDevOps hashtag#Git hashtag#GitHub hashtag#SoanrQube hashtag#Nexus hashtag#Tomcat hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#AwsDevOpsrole hashtag#DevopsEngineerrole hashtag#AWS hashtag#Recuirters

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Rohit varma MuthyamRohit varma Muthyam,,"🚀 Looking for DevOps Engineer roles 🙂 🚀 Successfully Deployed a Java Application to Multiple Environments Using Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline! 💻🔧I recently completed a DevOps workflow that automates the deployment of a Java-based application across multiple environments using Jenkins, Apache Tomcat, and GitHub. Here's a quick walkthrough of the project:🔁 Project Title:Deploying a Java Application to DEV, TEST, PRE-PROD, and PROD Environments using Jenkins Pipeline🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:Jenkins – for CI/CD automationGitHub – source code managementApache Tomcat – application servers across environmentsDeclarative Jenkins Pipeline – for clean, readable automationShell scripting – for deployment logic🔍 Workflow Summary:👤 User starts the process:Clones the application source code from GitHub.Writes a declarative Jenkins pipeline that handles build, test, and deploy stages.⚙️ Jenkins Pipeline:Pulls the code from GitHub.Builds the application (WAR file).Prompts the user (via input step) to choose the deployment environment:DEVTESTPRE-PRODPROD🚀 Deployment:Based on the user's input, the pipeline pushes the application to the respective Apache Tomcat server.Deployments are automated and consistent across environments.✅ Why This Matters:📦 Enables seamless and controlled deployment to various stages of development.🚨 Reduces manual errors and deployment delays.🧪 Improves testing consistency across environments.🔐 Promotes environmental isolation, better for security and debugging.hashtaghashtag#Devops hashtaghashtag#jenkins hashtaghashtag#CI_CD hashtaghashtag#GitHub hashtaghashtag#Tomcat hashtaghashtag#Automation hashtaghashtag#Deployment hashtaghashtag#AWSDevOps hashtaghashtag#AWS hashtaghashtag#Hiring hashtaghashtag#Recuiters hashtaghashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtaghashtag#HR hashtaghashtag#Cloudsupport #

mahesh laggalamahesh laggala,,"🚀 Looking for DevOps Engineer role 🙂 🚀 CI/CD Automation with Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus & Tomcat🔧 Tech Stack: Jenkins | GitHub | SonarQube | Nexus | Apache TomcatAs part of my DevOps journey, I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that automates the entire process from code integration to deployment. Here's a breakdown of the project:🔹 GitHub Integration – The pipeline is triggered automatically when code is pushed to a GitHub repository.🔹 Continuous Integration with Jenkins – Jenkins orchestrates the CI/CD process, building and testing the application on every code commit.🔹 Code Quality Analysis – Integrated SonarQube into the pipeline for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and identifying bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.🔹 Artifact Management – Leveraged Nexus Repository Manager to store and manage build artifacts securely.🔹 Deployment – Automated deployment of the final build to an Apache Tomcat server, enabling continuous delivery of updates.📈 Impact: This setup reduced manual interventions, ensured higher code quality, and accelerated the release cycle.Jenkins Pipeline 👇 :pipeline { agent any  stages { stage('checkout') { steps { checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://lnkd.in/gTq2KHZm']]) } } stage('validate') { steps { sh 'mvn validate' } } stage('compile') { steps { sh 'mvn compile' } } stage('test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } } stage('package') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } } stage('sonarqube') { steps { sh '''mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=train-ticket-reservation -Dsonar.projectName='train-ticket-reservation' -Dsonar.host.url=http://3.81.86.77:9000 -Dsonar.token=sqp_f49c90c472aec1b8ab45bbe0fea275eb392401d8''' } } stage('Nexus') { steps { nexusArtifactUploader artifacts: [[artifactId: 'TrainBook', classifier: '', file: '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Project/target/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war', type: 'war']], credentialsId: '51f559bc-8d05-4ffe-817b-5616ae857508', groupId: 'TrainBook', nexusUrl: '3.81.86.77', nexusVersion: 'nexus3', protocol: 'http', repository: 'maven-snapshots', version: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'  } }  stage('deploy to tomcat'){ steps{ deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat', path: '', url: 'http://3.81.86.77:8080/')], contextPath: null, onFailure: false, war: '/*.war' } } }}hashtag#Devops hashtag#jenkins hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#AWSDevOps hashtag#Git hashtag#GitHub hashtag#SoanrQube hashtag#Nexus hashtag#Tomcat hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#AwsDevOpsrole hashtag#DevopsEngineerrole hashtag#AWS hashtag#Recuirters

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

mahesh laggalamahesh laggala,,"🚀 Looking for DevOps Engineer role 🙂 🚀 CI/CD Automation with Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus & Tomcat🔧 Tech Stack: Jenkins | GitHub | SonarQube | Nexus | Apache TomcatAs part of my DevOps journey, I implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that automates the entire process from code integration to deployment. Here's a breakdown of the project:🔹 GitHub Integration – The pipeline is triggered automatically when code is pushed to a GitHub repository.🔹 Continuous Integration with Jenkins – Jenkins orchestrates the CI/CD process, building and testing the application on every code commit.🔹 Code Quality Analysis – Integrated SonarQube into the pipeline for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and identifying bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.🔹 Artifact Management – Leveraged Nexus Repository Manager to store and manage build artifacts securely.🔹 Deployment – Automated deployment of the final build to an Apache Tomcat server, enabling continuous delivery of updates.📈 Impact: This setup reduced manual interventions, ensured higher code quality, and accelerated the release cycle.Jenkins Pipeline 👇 :pipeline { agent any  stages { stage('checkout') { steps { checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://lnkd.in/gTq2KHZm']]) } } stage('validate') { steps { sh 'mvn validate' } } stage('compile') { steps { sh 'mvn compile' } } stage('test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } } stage('package') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } } stage('sonarqube') { steps { sh '''mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=train-ticket-reservation -Dsonar.projectName='train-ticket-reservation' -Dsonar.host.url=http://3.81.86.77:9000 -Dsonar.token=sqp_f49c90c472aec1b8ab45bbe0fea275eb392401d8''' } } stage('Nexus') { steps { nexusArtifactUploader artifacts: [[artifactId: 'TrainBook', classifier: '', file: '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Project/target/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war', type: 'war']], credentialsId: '51f559bc-8d05-4ffe-817b-5616ae857508', groupId: 'TrainBook', nexusUrl: '3.81.86.77', nexusVersion: 'nexus3', protocol: 'http', repository: 'maven-snapshots', version: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'  } }  stage('deploy to tomcat'){ steps{ deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat', path: '', url: 'http://3.81.86.77:8080/')], contextPath: null, onFailure: false, war: '/*.war' } } }}hashtag#Devops hashtag#jenkins hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#AWSDevOps hashtag#Git hashtag#GitHub hashtag#SoanrQube hashtag#Nexus hashtag#Tomcat hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#AwsDevOpsrole hashtag#DevopsEngineerrole hashtag#AWS hashtag#Recuirters

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.

Here's a breakdown of the project:🔹 GitHub Integration – The pipeline is triggered automatically when code is pushed to a GitHub repository.🔹 Continuous Integration with Jenkins – Jenkins orchestrates the CI/CD process, building and testing the application on every code commit.🔹 Code Quality Analysis – Integrated SonarQube into the pipeline for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and identifying bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.🔹 Artifact Management – Leveraged Nexus Repository Manager to store and manage build artifacts securely.🔹 Deployment – Automated deployment of the final build to an Apache Tomcat server, enabling continuous delivery of updates.📈 Impact: This setup reduced manual interventions, ensured higher code quality, and accelerated the release cycle.Jenkins Pipeline 👇 :pipeline { agent any  stages { stage('checkout') { steps { checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://lnkd.in/gTq2KHZm']]) } } stage('validate') { steps { sh 'mvn validate' } } stage('compile') { steps { sh 'mvn compile' } } stage('test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } } stage('package') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } } stage('sonarqube') { steps { sh '''mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=train-ticket-reservation -Dsonar.projectName='train-ticket-reservation' -Dsonar.host.url=http://3.81.86.77:9000 -Dsonar.token=sqp_f49c90c472aec1b8ab45bbe0fea275eb392401d8''' } } stage('Nexus') { steps { nexusArtifactUploader artifacts: [[artifactId: 'TrainBook', classifier: '', file: '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Project/target/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war', type: 'war']], credentialsId: '51f559bc-8d05-4ffe-817b-5616ae857508', groupId: 'TrainBook', nexusUrl: '3.81.86.77', nexusVersion: 'nexus3', protocol: 'http', repository: 'maven-snapshots', version: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'  } }  stage('deploy to tomcat'){ steps{ deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat', path: '', url: 'http://3.81.86.77:8080/')], contextPath: null, onFailure: false, war: '/*.war' } } }}hashtag#Devops hashtag#jenkins hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#AWSDevOps hashtag#Git hashtag#GitHub hashtag#SoanrQube hashtag#Nexus hashtag#Tomcat hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#AwsDevOpsrole hashtag#DevopsEngineerrole hashtag#AWS hashtag#Recuirters

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Here's a breakdown of the project:🔹 GitHub Integration – The pipeline is triggered automatically when code is pushed to a GitHub repository.🔹 Continuous Integration with Jenkins – Jenkins orchestrates the CI/CD process, building and testing the application on every code commit.🔹 Code Quality Analysis – Integrated SonarQube into the pipeline for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and identifying bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities.🔹 Artifact Management – Leveraged Nexus Repository Manager to store and manage build artifacts securely.🔹 Deployment – Automated deployment of the final build to an Apache Tomcat server, enabling continuous delivery of updates.📈 Impact: This setup reduced manual interventions, ensured higher code quality, and accelerated the release cycle.Jenkins Pipeline 👇 :pipeline { agent any  stages { stage('checkout') { steps { checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://lnkd.in/gTq2KHZm']]) } } stage('validate') { steps { sh 'mvn validate' } } stage('compile') { steps { sh 'mvn compile' } } stage('test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } } stage('package') { steps { sh 'mvn package' } } stage('sonarqube') { steps { sh '''mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=train-ticket-reservation -Dsonar.projectName='train-ticket-reservation' -Dsonar.host.url=http://3.81.86.77:9000 -Dsonar.token=sqp_f49c90c472aec1b8ab45bbe0fea275eb392401d8''' } } stage('Nexus') { steps { nexusArtifactUploader artifacts: [[artifactId: 'TrainBook', classifier: '', file: '/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/Project/target/TrainBook-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war', type: 'war']], credentialsId: '51f559bc-8d05-4ffe-817b-5616ae857508', groupId: 'TrainBook', nexusUrl: '3.81.86.77', nexusVersion: 'nexus3', protocol: 'http', repository: 'maven-snapshots', version: '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'  } }  stage('deploy to tomcat'){ steps{ deploy adapters: [tomcat9(credentialsId: 'tomcat', path: '', url: 'http://3.81.86.77:8080/')], contextPath: null, onFailure: false, war: '/*.war' } } }}hashtag#Devops hashtag#jenkins hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#AWSDevOps hashtag#Git hashtag#GitHub hashtag#SoanrQube hashtag#Nexus hashtag#Tomcat hashtag#Hiring hashtag#HR hashtag#AwsDevOpsrole hashtag#DevopsEngineerrole hashtag#AWS hashtag#Recuirters

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves.

VETASSESS may consider this experience for a skills assessment, but only if specific additional requirements are met.For occupations classified under Groups B, C, and D, applicants must demonstrate:• A period of highly relevant pre-qualification employment at the required skill level, and• At least one year of highly relevant employment performed within the last five years before applying.The additional pre-qualification experience required is as follows:• Group B: At least five extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.• Groups C and D: At least three extra years of relevant employment prior to the qualification.This methodology allows applicants who have been working in the field before completing their studies to still be eligible for a positive skills assessment — provided they clearly demonstrate the employment was at the required skill level.For Example: Civil Engineering Draftsperson (Group C Occupation)• Qualification: Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering• Work Experience: Involved in civil engineering drafting projects even before completing the bachelor's degreeDespite holding a degree in a different discipline, the candidate has:• 3 years of highly relevant pre-qualification work experience, and• 1 year of relevant employment within the last 5 yearsThis makes them eligible for a positive skills assessment as a Civil Engineering Draftsperson under Group C through VETASSESS, using the pre-qualification employment pathway.Kind regards!Zara Wangchuk Senior Skills Assessment expert +61 481 607 652/ +61 483 931 112zara@cdrwritersaustralia.comFacebook- https://lnkd.in/gNBGSxBJLinkedIn-https: https://lnkd.in/gMahbYE6WhatsApp Group- https://lnkd.in/gedzveHJ

Riya SharmaRiya Sharma,,"Experience is valuable—but it’s not everything. hashtag#fresher hashtag#experience Every industry veteran once stood at the starting line—no titles, no years of experience, just raw passion and potential.Yet today, many freshers face closed doors simply because they don’t have ""x years"" on a résumé.But here’s a reality check 👇 📌 Experience is earned— not something you're born with. 📌 Potential can’t always be measured in years.🚀 Why Freshers Are Secret Weapons for Growth:🔹 Original Thinking – They aren’t limited by “how things have always been done.” That means fresh ideas, new angles, and innovative solutions.🔹 Quick Adaptability – Tech evolves. Markets change. Freshers are wired to learn fast and pivot faster.🔹 Unmatched Energy – They're driven, curious, and ready to prove themselves. That hustle? It’s gold.🔹 Coachability > Conditioning – With no rigid habits or egos, freshers can be mentored into high-performers and future leaders.The Real Issue?We confuse experience with capability. We reject talent before it even gets a chance to grow.If every company waits for candidates with experience… Who will create the next generation of experienced professionals?✅ Smart companies don’t just hire résumés—they hire potential. They ask: 🔍 “Can this person grow into greatness?” Not just: ❌ “Do they check every box today?”💡 Freshers don’t come with baggage—they come with boldness. Nurture them, invest in them, and they’ll build your future.👉 Have you witnessed a fresher outshine a seasoned pro? Let’s hear your story! Drop it in the comments below. 👇Let’s change the narrative. Let’s give potential a chance. 💼💥Follow me for more thoughts on hiring, leadership, and building future-ready teams.
