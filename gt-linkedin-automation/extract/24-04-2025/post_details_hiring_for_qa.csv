Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed.

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch

Alexander YudinAlexander Yudin,,"“Alexander, you’re invited to an interview with Tabby 😎”That was the subject line.The tone? Warm. Welcoming. Excited.The role? Senior QA Automation Engineer (Golang).The next step? Just one click to schedule.I clicked. The page loaded… but there was no way to actually schedule a call.No calendar. No time slots. Just a vague “Something went wrong” message.I tried everything: different browsers, devices, incognito mode, clearing cache.Still nothing.So I did what the email said—replied directly to the hiring team:“Hi guys. I was trying to schedule an interview, but encountered some indescribable issue…”No response.I kept digging.Opened the dev console. Spotted the bug.Turns out, my timezone wasn’t listed in their application’s array.So I sent another follow-up:“Actually, that’s fun, but I’ve already found a bug in your application…”I included logs, screenshots—everything they’d need.It’s now been over a week. Still no reply.And honestly—this experience wasn’t just about a broken scheduling tool.It was about the silence that followed. The feeling of being left hanging.This wasn’t just a glitch.It was a breakdown in communication, in follow-through, in care.Not the outcome I expected—but definitely an experience worth sharing.Has anyone else run into similar issues while interviewing?hashtag#hiringprocess hashtag#candidateexperience hashtag#qaengineering hashtag#techglitches hashtag#jobsearch
