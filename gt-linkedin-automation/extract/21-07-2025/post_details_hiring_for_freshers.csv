Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters

Saloni MalikSaloni Malik,,"Dear HR teams, founders, and everyone who’s ever hired an intern,Most internships feel the same.You join. You overthink everything.You pitch an idea, they smile, then ignore it.You do ""tasks"" just to stay busy.You leave with a certificate… but no real growth.Zero ownership. Zero trust. Zero impact.But my last internship was like every fresher's dream internship.I wasn’t just “the intern.”I was part of the team.I pitched bold ideas, some flopped, some flew.But I had the space to try.It was about the trust.And that trust?That’s what made me care more. Do better. Show up fully.If you’re hiring interns, here’s something to think about:We don’t need bean bags, or pizza Fridays.We need to feel like our ideas matter. Like our effort isn’t invisible. Like we’re building something that counts.That’s how you turn an internship into a turning point.Thank you, Fabrikaloom, for setting the bar high.Sincerely,One intern who’ll never forget what good leadership feels like.hashtag#internshipdiaries hashtag#genzworkplace hashtag#hrcommunity hashtag#linkedincommunity hashtag#workculturematters
