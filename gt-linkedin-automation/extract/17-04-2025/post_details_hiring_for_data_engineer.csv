Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte

Ken OkamuraKen Okamura,,"Can Tesla Survive 2025? 3 Red Flags Investors Shouldn’t Ignore📺 Watch the full video breakdown here → https://lnkd.in/gQPvrgwnTesla has always been a company that thrives on bold moves and ambitious visions—but as we head deeper into 2025, some critical challenges are emerging. In this post, we’ll explore three major developments that could significantly impact Tesla’s future—and what they mean for investors, owners, and fans of the company.⚠️ 1. Tesla’s Market Share in California Is Dropping FastCalifornia has long been Tesla’s stronghold—but recent data reveals a worrying trend. In Q1 2025, Tesla’s share of the EV market in California dropped to 43.9%, down from 55.5% a year earlier. That’s a 12-point decline in just one year.While Tesla’s registrations fell by 15%, other EV makers saw a 35% surge. The takeaway? Tesla isn’t just slowing down—its rivals are speeding up.Industry experts point to two main reasons:Tesla’s product lineup is aging, with limited updates to Models S, X, 3, and Y.Elon Musk’s political and social media activity may be turning off some buyers.While Model Y and Model 3 remain best-sellers, declining market share could impact resale values and Tesla’s overall brand power.💥 2. Cybercab and Semi Face Delays Due to TariffsAnother red flag: new tariffs may disrupt Tesla’s ambitious plans for next-gen vehicles like the Cybercab and the Semi truck.Reports indicate that tariffs on Chinese-made parts could rise as high as 145% under new trade policies. In response, Tesla has reportedly halted parts imports from China—potentially delaying the October 2025 prototype production and pushing back mass production to 2026.Tesla had previously absorbed tariffs up to 34%, but beyond that, costs become unsustainable.However, despite these hurdles, Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company is actively hiring for its Robotaxi division, including roles like Diagnostics Engineer, Robotaxi Operations—a clear sign it’s still investing in autonomous driving as a long-term growth engine.🌏 3. Tesla Accelerates Its Expansion Into IndiaWhile Tesla faces challenges in California and with supply chains, it’s also entering a massive new market—India.The company has posted over 25 job openings in India, many related to charging infrastructure, battery materials, and supply chain operations—not just retail or sales.One job listing specifically mentioned expertise in LFP and NMC battery materials, hinting that Tesla may be planning to source or produce batteries locally.Adding to the excitement, the Model Y was spotted test-driving in Mumbai, suggesting real-world trials are already underway.With over 1.4 billion people and a fast-growing demand for EVs, India has the potential to become Tesla’s next big growth engine—alongside the U.S. and China.

Roosiel AgramonteRoosiel Agramonte,,"Not another social media series! 😩Here’s mine:A cover letter a day! Join me while I write cover letters to companies I’m applying to. My goal is to fill the cover letters with personality and make it less of a drag.Here’s my first one in the series:Dear Hiring Team,I'm a software engineer who builds full-stack applications that center people — their stories, their connections, their needs. When I came across TailorCare’s mission to make specialty care more personal and more effective, it resonated deeply with how I think about good technology: it should guide, empower, and remove friction from people’s lives.Most recently, I built Foodship, an application that helps people foster new friendships over shared meals. Users set up a profile, share their food preferences, pick a time, and get matched with others and a compatible restaurant. To support meaningful interactions, I use a chat completion model with a psychotherapist-inspired prompt to generate curated conversation questions designed to spark trust and reflection. I designed and built this app — front to back — using EJS, CSS/SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, Socket.io, Agenda.js, Hugging Face API, and MongoDB.What draws me to TailorCare is the chance to collaborate across disciplines to build systems that are technically sound, human-centered, and impactful. Your work sits at the intersection of data, healthcare, and empathy — and that’s where I want to be. I bring a fast-learning mindset, clean code, and strong collaboration skills. I’m also no stranger to debugging odd issues at 2 a.m. or chasing down a race condition like it owes me money.Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’d love to connect and learn more about what you’re building at TailorCare.Warmly,Roosiel Agramonte
