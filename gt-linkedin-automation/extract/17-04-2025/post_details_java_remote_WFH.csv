Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language.

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution.

In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs.

Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1.

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs.

Srishti SharmaSrishti Sharma,,"Designing Intelligent Systems from Concept to Code: Bridging System Architecture with UML and SimulinkRecently, I’ve been working on system architecture design for one of the Module (Radiator Fan Control) by combining the strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with UML (Unified Modeling Language) to create clear, structured, and scalable embedded system designs.This approach enables: •	Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) workflows •	Early validation through simulation •	Precise representation of system behavior using UML diagrams (state machines, sequence diagrams, class models) •	Streamlined code generation from Simulink modelsUsing UML alongside Simulink helps bridge the gap between high-level design and implementation, making communication across teams more effective and reducing integration risks.It’s been a rewarding experience watching abstract system concepts come to life with a well-modeled foundation.Are you using UML in your system design process?

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Freitas,,"Digital nomads aren’t dead.I met plenty of them during a trip to Medellín, Colombia.Most were working in online sales or digital marketing, but many were also project managers or business associates.So here's the question:What roles could an interpreter transition into—roles that allow more remote freedom than OPI?Freedom meaning: – No need for a private HIPAA-compliant room – No 500mb internet connection requirements – The ability to work from a hostel, a café, or a co-working spotI've got a few in mind—each rooted in communication, language, and management:Project ManagerBusiness AssociateExecutive AssistantCommunity ManagerBut I’m curious—what else would you suggest?Because for me, life’s too short to be tied to one city.And when adventure enters the picture, my productivity skyrockets.

Waela FellnertWaela Fellnert,,"Working from home isn’t always cute.Sometimes it’s:🌀 17 tabs open😵 3 tasks half-done🙃 0 human interactionIn those moments, here’s what helps me stay sane:I give myself grace.Not fake-it-til-you-make-it grace.REAL grace. The kind that says:• “It’s okay that your brain is foggy today.”• “You’re not lazy—you’re overwhelmed.”• “You’re allowed to pause, breathe, reset.”Remote work isn’t just about tools and systems.It’s about self-kindness, especially on the messy days.That’s the real productivity hack.💭 Ever have one of those days too?Save this as a reminder.

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Srishti SharmaSrishti Sharma,,"Designing Intelligent Systems from Concept to Code: Bridging System Architecture with UML and SimulinkRecently, I’ve been working on system architecture design for one of the Module (Radiator Fan Control) by combining the strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with UML (Unified Modeling Language) to create clear, structured, and scalable embedded system designs.This approach enables: •	Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) workflows •	Early validation through simulation •	Precise representation of system behavior using UML diagrams (state machines, sequence diagrams, class models) •	Streamlined code generation from Simulink modelsUsing UML alongside Simulink helps bridge the gap between high-level design and implementation, making communication across teams more effective and reducing integration risks.It’s been a rewarding experience watching abstract system concepts come to life with a well-modeled foundation.Are you using UML in your system design process?

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Jemma VisserJemma Visser,,"Remote work vs. in-office work: a constant tug-of-war.As someone who works remotely for an in-person organisation and studies remotely for an in-person master's, I often ask myself: Did I choose the right place to live?Some weeks, I’m convinced I’ve nailed the balance. Other weeks—like after last week's strategic breakaway hosted by Inscape in Pretoria—I feel like I’m missing out.Being at Inscape, surrounded by its vibrant energy, felt like stepping into a dream. Who else plays 30 Seconds, has hula hoop competitions, and an on-site Platō Coffee? It wasn’t just work—it was a celebration of connection, creativity, and company culture. It made me feel like someone who works at Inscape, not just for Inscape.But then there's remote work. The flexibility. The freedom. The magic of Eza Ferreira and I, working for two different companies, side by side, lunch with breathtaking views and our own rhythm. That, too, is a dream in its own right.There’s no perfect answer. Just seasons, context, and personal values.👉 I’m curious—what works best for you? Remote or in-person? And why?hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#companyculture hashtag#careerchoices hashtag#flexibility hashtag#Inscape hashtag#worklifebalance

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Other weeks—like after last week's strategic breakaway hosted by Inscape in Pretoria—I feel like I’m missing out.Being at Inscape, surrounded by its vibrant energy, felt like stepping into a dream.

It made me feel like someone who works at Inscape, not just for Inscape.But then there's remote work. The flexibility. The freedom. The magic of Eza Ferreira and I, working for two different companies, side by side, lunch with breathtaking views and our own rhythm. That, too, is a dream in its own right.There’s no perfect answer.

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs.

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Jemma VisserJemma Visser,,"Remote work vs. in-office work: a constant tug-of-war.As someone who works remotely for an in-person organisation and studies remotely for an in-person master's, I often ask myself: Did I choose the right place to live?Some weeks, I’m convinced I’ve nailed the balance. Other weeks—like after last week's strategic breakaway hosted by Inscape in Pretoria—I feel like I’m missing out.Being at Inscape, surrounded by its vibrant energy, felt like stepping into a dream. Who else plays 30 Seconds, has hula hoop competitions, and an on-site Platō Coffee? It wasn’t just work—it was a celebration of connection, creativity, and company culture. It made me feel like someone who works at Inscape, not just for Inscape.But then there's remote work. The flexibility. The freedom. The magic of Eza Ferreira and I, working for two different companies, side by side, lunch with breathtaking views and our own rhythm. That, too, is a dream in its own right.There’s no perfect answer. Just seasons, context, and personal values.👉 I’m curious—what works best for you? Remote or in-person? And why?hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#companyculture hashtag#careerchoices hashtag#flexibility hashtag#Inscape hashtag#worklifebalance

Bojana MartinovićBojana Martinović,,"I'm excited to share that my latest research paper — developed in collaboration with two of my professors from the master’s degree program at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Banja Luka — has been officially published on IEEE Xplore!Presented at the 24th International Symposium INFOTEH-JAHORINA, the paper addresses the challenge of ensuring configuration consistency in modern network devices. With the growing number of devices and the complexity of their configurations, it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that the active configurations align with their desired state. The research focuses on enhancing the reliability of network monitoring using the NETCONF protocol, continuously comparing configurations in XML format, and detecting errors in real-time. Our system helps identify discrepancies in device configurations and provides historical data to facilitate root-cause analysis, ultimately improving network performance and minimizing errors.📄 Read full paper on IEEE Xplore: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/du2sg7gh📄 Also available on ResearchGate: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dqpjzNqH

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Other weeks—like after last week's strategic breakaway hosted by Inscape in Pretoria—I feel like I’m missing out.Being at Inscape, surrounded by its vibrant energy, felt like stepping into a dream. Who else plays 30 Seconds, has hula hoop competitions, and an on-site Platō Coffee? It wasn’t just work—it was a celebration of connection, creativity, and company culture. It made me feel like someone who works at Inscape, not just for Inscape.But then there's remote work. The flexibility. The freedom. The magic of Eza Ferreira and I, working for two different companies, side by side, lunch with breathtaking views and our own rhythm. That, too, is a dream in its own right.There’s no perfect answer.

With the growing number of devices and the complexity of their configurations, it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that the active configurations align with their desired state. The research focuses on enhancing the reliability of network monitoring using the NETCONF protocol, continuously comparing configurations in XML format, and detecting errors in real-time. Our system helps identify discrepancies in device configurations and provides historical data to facilitate root-cause analysis, ultimately improving network performance and minimizing errors.📄 Read full paper on IEEE Xplore: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/du2sg7gh📄 Also available on ResearchGate: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dqpjzNqH

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Jemma VisserJemma Visser,,"Remote work vs. in-office work: a constant tug-of-war.As someone who works remotely for an in-person organisation and studies remotely for an in-person master's, I often ask myself: Did I choose the right place to live?Some weeks, I’m convinced I’ve nailed the balance. Other weeks—like after last week's strategic breakaway hosted by Inscape in Pretoria—I feel like I’m missing out.Being at Inscape, surrounded by its vibrant energy, felt like stepping into a dream. Who else plays 30 Seconds, has hula hoop competitions, and an on-site Platō Coffee? It wasn’t just work—it was a celebration of connection, creativity, and company culture. It made me feel like someone who works at Inscape, not just for Inscape.But then there's remote work. The flexibility. The freedom. The magic of Eza Ferreira and I, working for two different companies, side by side, lunch with breathtaking views and our own rhythm. That, too, is a dream in its own right.There’s no perfect answer. Just seasons, context, and personal values.👉 I’m curious—what works best for you? Remote or in-person? And why?hashtag#remotework hashtag#hybridwork hashtag#companyculture hashtag#careerchoices hashtag#flexibility hashtag#Inscape hashtag#worklifebalance

With the growing number of devices and the complexity of their configurations, it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that the active configurations align with their desired state. The research focuses on enhancing the reliability of network monitoring using the NETCONF protocol, continuously comparing configurations in XML format, and detecting errors in real-time. Our system helps identify discrepancies in device configurations and provides historical data to facilitate root-cause analysis, ultimately improving network performance and minimizing errors.📄 Read full paper on IEEE Xplore: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/du2sg7gh📄 Also available on ResearchGate: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dqpjzNqH

Pooja.V. ShindePooja.V. Shinde,,"✨ Robotic Arm Control via WebSockets and Arduino Nano 🤖I’m excited to share my latest project where I’ve successfully built a 3-DOF robotic arm using an Arduino Nano and Python! The control system is powered by WebSocket communication for real-time interaction.🔧Project Highlights:- Designed it by using TinkerCAD. - Control a 3-DOF robotic arm using servo motors.- Python-based CLI client sends angle data (via WebSocket) to the Arduino Nano, which moves the arm in real time.- WebSocket server handles communication between the Python client and the Arduino via serial.- The robotic arm responds to commands like `45, 90, 135` to set precise servo angles.💡Technologies Used:- Python(asyncio, websockets, pyserial) for the client-server communication.-Arduino Nano and servo motors to control the arm’s movements.- WebSocket protocol for seamless data transfer between the Python app and Arduino.🔩Key Takeaways:- Integrated real-time control using WebSocket. - Explored CLI-based communication as an alternative to GUI, focusing on command-line interface for control.🎯 Next Steps:- Exploring advanced features like automated movement patterns, feedback systems, and potential AI integration.🔗Check out the code on my GitHub! https://lnkd.in/dg_sFzcSFor many, this might seem like a basic project… but for me, it’s the beginning of something big.In just one day, I challenged myself to learn, build, debug, and bring a robotic arm to life using Arduino, Python, and WebSocket communication.From moving a single servo…To making all 3 work in sync…To sending real-time commands from my PC…Every step taught me how to turn code into movement, and logic into results.It’s not just a robotic arm — it’s my first real step into embedded systems and IoT.Grateful for how far I’ve come.
