Umeshkumar JainUmeshkumar Jain,,"🚀 THE ONE MISTAKE THAT COST ME $$$ IN MY FIRST REMOTE HIRE Early in UKValley’s journey, I hired a brilliant developer from another country. The skills were perfect. The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done. It’s about building a TEAM, not just talent. What’s your biggest remote hiring lesson? Drop a comment or DM me—I read every reply. hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#TechLeadership

Umeshkumar JainUmeshkumar Jain,,"🚀 THE ONE MISTAKE THAT COST ME $$$ IN MY FIRST REMOTE HIRE Early in UKValley’s journey, I hired a brilliant developer from another country. The skills were perfect. The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done. It’s about building a TEAM, not just talent. What’s your biggest remote hiring lesson? Drop a comment or DM me—I read every reply. hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#TechLeadership

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Umeshkumar JainUmeshkumar Jain,,"🚀 THE ONE MISTAKE THAT COST ME $$$ IN MY FIRST REMOTE HIRE Early in UKValley’s journey, I hired a brilliant developer from another country. The skills were perfect. The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done. It’s about building a TEAM, not just talent. What’s your biggest remote hiring lesson? Drop a comment or DM me—I read every reply. hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#TechLeadership
