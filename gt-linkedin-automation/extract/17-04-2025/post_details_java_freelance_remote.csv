But there are risks to each decision and circumstances that will come along that you need to be prepare for.✅ Constant adaptability: Tools, trends, and ways of working evolve quickly.✅ Global connection: You work with clients and teams across different time zones and cultures. Sometimes sleep might get affected but its your responsibility to put it first as well.✅ Continuous growth: Learning new skills is key to standing out in this environment.💡 If you want to excel in digital marketing, consulting, tech, or any remote career, the key is to think like a global professional.

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Umeshkumar JainUmeshkumar Jain,,"🚀 THE ONE MISTAKE THAT COST ME $$$ IN MY FIRST REMOTE HIRE Early in UKValley’s journey, I hired a brilliant developer from another country. The skills were perfect. The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done. It’s about building a TEAM, not just talent. What’s your biggest remote hiring lesson? Drop a comment or DM me—I read every reply. hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#StartupLessons hashtag#TechLeadership

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Umeshkumar JainUmeshkumar Jain,,"🚀 THE ONE MISTAKE THAT COST ME $$$ IN MY FIRST REMOTE HIRE Early in UKValley’s journey, I hired a brilliant developer from another country. The skills were perfect. The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Ahmed ElfalakyAhmed Elfalaky,,"‎النهارده هنتكلم عنملفات SCL (Substation Configuration Language) هي حجر الأساس في automation المحطات الكهربائية‎ملفات ال scl ‎ملفات SCL هي ملفات بصيغة XML بتوصف مكونات وإعدادات نظام ال automation في المحطة الكهربائية بطريقة موحدة. الملفات دي بتخلينا ننقل المعلومات والإعدادات بين الأجهزة والبرامج من مختلف الشركات المصنعة بسهولة، وده اللي بيخلي التوافق بين الأنظمة المختلفة ممكن.‎أنواع ملفات SCL‎1. ملف SSD (System Specification Description)‎ده الملف اللي بيوصف البنية الأساسية للنظام الكهربائي المطلوب عمل automation. بنستخدمه في بداية المشروع عشان نحدد: •	شكل شبكة المحطة الكهربائية (Single Line Diagram) •	الوظائف المطلوبة (Logical Nodes) من غير ما نحدد الأجهزة اللي هتنفذها •	مواصفات النظام بشكل عام من الناحية الوظيفية‎الملف ده بيبقى فيه أقسام الـ Substation والـ Data Type Templates وتعريفات الـ Logical Node Types، بس مش بيكون محتاج قسم الـ IED عشان لسه منحددناش الأجهزة بالظبط.‎2. ملف ICD (IED Capabilities Description)‎ده الملف اللي بيوصف إمكانيات الجهاز (IED) وبيبقى متوفر من الشركة المصنعة للجهاز. الملف ده بيحتوي على: •	قسم واحد للـ IED بيوصف كل إمكانيات الجهاز •	أقسام اختيارية للـ Communication •	أقسام اختيارية للـ Substation بتوضح الكيانات الفيزيائية المرتبطة بالجهاز‎يعني ببساطة، ده كتالوج إلكتروني كامل عن الجهاز وكل حاجة ممكن يعملها. ده بيبقى الأساس اللي بنبني عليه نظام الـ IEC 61850 بتاعنا.‎3. ملف SCD (Substation Configuration Description)‎ده أهم ملف في النظام كله، عشان بيحتوي على ال configuration الكامل للنظام بتاعنا. الملف ده بيشمل: •	العلاقة مع البنية الكهربائية للمحطة‎الملف ده بينتج من دمج ملف الـ SSD مع ملفات الـ ICD للأجهزة المختلفة. ده الملف اللي بنستخدمه لإدارة النظام بالكامل، وعشان كده PcVue وأنظمة SCADA التانية بتوصي باستخدامه.‎4. ملف CID (Configured IED Description)‎ده ملف بيخص جهاز واحد فقط بعد ما تم تكوينه. ممكن نعتبره نسخة مصغرة من ملف الـ SCD فيها بس المعلومات اللي الجهاز محتاجها عشان يشتغل. بيحتوي على: •	معلومات الـ GOOSE messages اللي الجهاز بينشرها •	المعلومات المتاحة للعملاء المختلفين‎ده الملف اللي بنحمله على الجهاز في النهاية عشان يعرف دوره في النظام الكامل.‎5. ملف IID (Instantiated IED Description)‎ده ملف بيتولد بواسطة أداة هندسة الـ IED بعد تكوين اشتراكات الـ GOOSE وتعيين الإشارات للمنطق الداخلي. بيحتوي على: •	قسم واحد للـ IED ‎ده بيكون ملف وسيط بين أداة تكوين الجهاز وأداة تكوين النظام، يعني بيسهل عملية التكامل بين الأدوات المختلفة.‎6. ملف SED (System Exchange Description)‎ده ملف بيستخدم لتبادل معلومات النظام بين أدوات هندسية مختلفة. مش مذكور بالتفصيل في المعيار زي باقي الملفات، لكن بيلعب دور مهم في تبادل ال configuration بين الشركات المختلفة.‎العلاقة بين الملفات والتطبيق العملي‎لو عايزين نفهم سير العمل : 1.	بنبدأ بملف SSD اللي بيوصف المحطة ومتطلباتها الوظيفية 2.	بناخد ملفات ICD من مختلف الموردين للأجهزة 3.	بندمجهم في ملف SCD واحد بيوصف النظام كله 4.	بنستخرج ملفات CID للأجهزة الفردية 5.	كل جهاز بيتحمل عليه ملف الـ CID بتاعه‎عملياً، بنستخدم أدوات زي PcVue عشان نضيف ملفات SCL لتكوين شبكة IEC 61850 ونحدد عناصر التكوين المختلفة زي الأجهزة ومجموعات البيانات.

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Ahmed ElfalakyAhmed Elfalaky,,"‎النهارده هنتكلم عنملفات SCL (Substation Configuration Language) هي حجر الأساس في automation المحطات الكهربائية‎ملفات ال scl ‎ملفات SCL هي ملفات بصيغة XML بتوصف مكونات وإعدادات نظام ال automation في المحطة الكهربائية بطريقة موحدة. الملفات دي بتخلينا ننقل المعلومات والإعدادات بين الأجهزة والبرامج من مختلف الشركات المصنعة بسهولة، وده اللي بيخلي التوافق بين الأنظمة المختلفة ممكن.‎أنواع ملفات SCL‎1. ملف SSD (System Specification Description)‎ده الملف اللي بيوصف البنية الأساسية للنظام الكهربائي المطلوب عمل automation. بنستخدمه في بداية المشروع عشان نحدد: •	شكل شبكة المحطة الكهربائية (Single Line Diagram) •	الوظائف المطلوبة (Logical Nodes) من غير ما نحدد الأجهزة اللي هتنفذها •	مواصفات النظام بشكل عام من الناحية الوظيفية‎الملف ده بيبقى فيه أقسام الـ Substation والـ Data Type Templates وتعريفات الـ Logical Node Types، بس مش بيكون محتاج قسم الـ IED عشان لسه منحددناش الأجهزة بالظبط.‎2. ملف ICD (IED Capabilities Description)‎ده الملف اللي بيوصف إمكانيات الجهاز (IED) وبيبقى متوفر من الشركة المصنعة للجهاز. الملف ده بيحتوي على: •	قسم واحد للـ IED بيوصف كل إمكانيات الجهاز •	أقسام اختيارية للـ Communication •	أقسام اختيارية للـ Substation بتوضح الكيانات الفيزيائية المرتبطة بالجهاز‎يعني ببساطة، ده كتالوج إلكتروني كامل عن الجهاز وكل حاجة ممكن يعملها. ده بيبقى الأساس اللي بنبني عليه نظام الـ IEC 61850 بتاعنا.‎3. ملف SCD (Substation Configuration Description)‎ده أهم ملف في النظام كله، عشان بيحتوي على ال configuration الكامل للنظام بتاعنا. الملف ده بيشمل: •	العلاقة مع البنية الكهربائية للمحطة‎الملف ده بينتج من دمج ملف الـ SSD مع ملفات الـ ICD للأجهزة المختلفة. ده الملف اللي بنستخدمه لإدارة النظام بالكامل، وعشان كده PcVue وأنظمة SCADA التانية بتوصي باستخدامه.‎4. ملف CID (Configured IED Description)‎ده ملف بيخص جهاز واحد فقط بعد ما تم تكوينه. ممكن نعتبره نسخة مصغرة من ملف الـ SCD فيها بس المعلومات اللي الجهاز محتاجها عشان يشتغل. بيحتوي على: •	معلومات الـ GOOSE messages اللي الجهاز بينشرها •	المعلومات المتاحة للعملاء المختلفين‎ده الملف اللي بنحمله على الجهاز في النهاية عشان يعرف دوره في النظام الكامل.‎5. ملف IID (Instantiated IED Description)‎ده ملف بيتولد بواسطة أداة هندسة الـ IED بعد تكوين اشتراكات الـ GOOSE وتعيين الإشارات للمنطق الداخلي. بيحتوي على: •	قسم واحد للـ IED ‎ده بيكون ملف وسيط بين أداة تكوين الجهاز وأداة تكوين النظام، يعني بيسهل عملية التكامل بين الأدوات المختلفة.‎6. ملف SED (System Exchange Description)‎ده ملف بيستخدم لتبادل معلومات النظام بين أدوات هندسية مختلفة. مش مذكور بالتفصيل في المعيار زي باقي الملفات، لكن بيلعب دور مهم في تبادل ال configuration بين الشركات المختلفة.‎العلاقة بين الملفات والتطبيق العملي‎لو عايزين نفهم سير العمل : 1.	بنبدأ بملف SSD اللي بيوصف المحطة ومتطلباتها الوظيفية 2.	بناخد ملفات ICD من مختلف الموردين للأجهزة 3.	بندمجهم في ملف SCD واحد بيوصف النظام كله 4.	بنستخرج ملفات CID للأجهزة الفردية 5.	كل جهاز بيتحمل عليه ملف الـ CID بتاعه‎عملياً، بنستخدم أدوات زي PcVue عشان نضيف ملفات SCL لتكوين شبكة IEC 61850 ونحدد عناصر التكوين المختلفة زي الأجهزة ومجموعات البيانات.

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Maria Carolina CandanedoMaria Carolina Candanedo,,"🌍 Remote Work Mindset: More Than a Lifestyle, a Way of Thinking 🚀Remote work is not just about opening your laptop from anywhere; it's about developing a flexible, strategic mindset focused on results. 🔥✅ Self-management and discipline: No one will tell you what to do every minute; you own your time. But there are risks to each decision and circumstances that will come along that you need to be prepare for.✅ Constant adaptability: Tools, trends, and ways of working evolve quickly.✅ Global connection: You work with clients and teams across different time zones and cultures. Sometimes sleep might get affected but its your responsibility to put it first as well.✅ Continuous growth: Learning new skills is key to standing out in this environment.💡 If you want to excel in digital marketing, consulting, tech, or any remote career, the key is to think like a global professional.

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation.

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

But there are risks to each decision and circumstances that will come along that you need to be prepare for.✅ Constant adaptability: Tools, trends, and ways of working evolve quickly.✅ Global connection: You work with clients and teams across different time zones and cultures. Sometimes sleep might get affected but its your responsibility to put it first as well.✅ Continuous growth: Learning new skills is key to standing out in this environment.💡 If you want to excel in digital marketing, consulting, tech, or any remote career, the key is to think like a global professional.

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

But there are risks to each decision and circumstances that will come along that you need to be prepare for.✅ Constant adaptability: Tools, trends, and ways of working evolve quickly.✅ Global connection: You work with clients and teams across different time zones and cultures. Sometimes sleep might get affected but its your responsibility to put it first as well.✅ Continuous growth: Learning new skills is key to standing out in this environment.💡 If you want to excel in digital marketing, consulting, tech, or any remote career, the key is to think like a global professional.

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation.

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Srishti SharmaSrishti Sharma,,"Designing Intelligent Systems from Concept to Code: Bridging System Architecture with UML and SimulinkRecently, I’ve been working on system architecture design for one of the Module (Radiator Fan Control) by combining the strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with UML (Unified Modeling Language) to create clear, structured, and scalable embedded system designs.This approach enables: •	Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) workflows •	Early validation through simulation •	Precise representation of system behavior using UML diagrams (state machines, sequence diagrams, class models) •	Streamlined code generation from Simulink modelsUsing UML alongside Simulink helps bridge the gap between high-level design and implementation, making communication across teams more effective and reducing integration risks.It’s been a rewarding experience watching abstract system concepts come to life with a well-modeled foundation.Are you using UML in your system design process?

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

But there are risks to each decision and circumstances that will come along that you need to be prepare for.✅ Constant adaptability: Tools, trends, and ways of working evolve quickly.✅ Global connection: You work with clients and teams across different time zones and cultures. Sometimes sleep might get affected but its your responsibility to put it first as well.✅ Continuous growth: Learning new skills is key to standing out in this environment.💡 If you want to excel in digital marketing, consulting, tech, or any remote career, the key is to think like a global professional.

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation.

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Srishti SharmaSrishti Sharma,,"Designing Intelligent Systems from Concept to Code: Bridging System Architecture with UML and SimulinkRecently, I’ve been working on system architecture design for one of the Module (Radiator Fan Control) by combining the strengths of MATLAB/Simulink with UML (Unified Modeling Language) to create clear, structured, and scalable embedded system designs.This approach enables: •	Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) workflows •	Early validation through simulation •	Precise representation of system behavior using UML diagrams (state machines, sequence diagrams, class models) •	Streamlined code generation from Simulink modelsUsing UML alongside Simulink helps bridge the gap between high-level design and implementation, making communication across teams more effective and reducing integration risks.It’s been a rewarding experience watching abstract system concepts come to life with a well-modeled foundation.Are you using UML in your system design process?

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Rom EisenbergRom Eisenberg,,"מהפכת ה-MCP כבר כאן – והנה איך השתמשתי בה כדי להפוך את Claude לעוזר חיפוש משרות חכםלאחרונה, Anthropic השיקה את Model Context Protocol (MCP) – פרוטוקול פתוח שמאפשר למודלים של בינה מלאכותית לתקשר עם מקורות מידע חיצוניים בצורה מאובטחת, סטנדרטית וגמישה. במקום לכתוב אינטגרציות מותאמות לכל מערכת, MCP מציע שפה אחידה שמאפשרת למודלים כמו Claude להבין ולגשת לכלים ולנתונים חיצוניים.🎯 רציתי לנסות את זה בעצמיזה נושא מאוד חם עכשיו, והחלטתי שאם כבר אני צולל לתוך MCP – למה לא להוציא מזה גם ערך מוסף?אז בניתי שרת MCP שמתחבר ל-API של לינקדאין, אוסף משרות רלוונטיות, ומעביר אותן ל-Claude דרך Claude Desktop.בניתי את זה כך שיאפשר לי להזין פרומפט פשוט כמו ""חפש לי משרות Software Engineer Intern בישראל"", ו-Claude מבצע את כל התהליך – מחיפוש ועד הצגת המשרות – בצורה אוטומטית, נוחה ומרשימה.🛠️הטכנולוגיה מאחורי הקלעים:⚫ ה-MCP מאפשר ל-Claude לתקשר עם השרת שלי בצורה מאובטחת וסטנדרטית.⚫ הClaude Desktop משמש כ-host שמתווך בין ה-AI למקורות המידע.⚫ הכל בנוי בצורה מודולרית, כך שקל להוסיף תכונות חדשות ולשפר את החוויה.אם אתם מפתחים שמתעניינים באינטגרציה בין AI לעולם האמיתי, ממליץ לבדוק את MCP. ואם אתם במקרה מגייסים או מכירים משרה שיכולה להתאים –  אשמח לשמוע 😄🔗 למידע נוסף על MCP: https://lnkd.in/dTAmNBu8🔗 ניתן לראות הקוד לשרת באתר שלי: https://lnkd.in/dd32-iMf

"Kathleen Strickland, MBAKathleen Strickland, MBA",,"🏠 Fostering authentic connections in remote work:  As a Parexel employee in our remote-friendly environment, these insights resonated with me. They remind us that while technology enables remote work, it's our intentional efforts that build strong teams.- Intentionality is key: Without office ""distractions,"" we must create structured opportunities for team bonding.- Active relationship-building: Remote work requires deliberate efforts to connect, potentially leading to deeper relationships.- Importance of emotional intelligence: Leaders should show openness and vulnerability to build trust in virtual environments.- Creating ""downtime"": We need to curate opportunities for teams to slow down and focus on building camaraderie.Fellow Parexel colleagues, how do these learnings align with your remote work experiences? What strategies have you found effective in maintaining team cohesion?

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Nourhan GamalNourhan Gamal,,"إزاي تكون HR ناجح؟ 🤔 في البوست اللي فات تكلمنا عن أول عنصر من عناصر النجاح في مجال الـ HR وهو الـ Knowledge 💡 والنهاردة جه دور Skills ✨ وده يمكن أهم جزء فعلًا! لأن المهارات هي اللي بتفرق في التطبيق الحقيقي، مش بس في الشهادات.وعلشان الموضوع كبير، هنقسمه على جزئين، والنهاردة هنتكلم عن أول نوعين من الـ Skills: 🗣️ 1. Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs.

The system follows a publisher-subscriber model, where control commands are sent from a client interface to the HiveMQ server, which then relays them to the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 processes these messages and switches the LEDs on or off in real time.

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Rom EisenbergRom Eisenberg,,"מהפכת ה-MCP כבר כאן – והנה איך השתמשתי בה כדי להפוך את Claude לעוזר חיפוש משרות חכםלאחרונה, Anthropic השיקה את Model Context Protocol (MCP) – פרוטוקול פתוח שמאפשר למודלים של בינה מלאכותית לתקשר עם מקורות מידע חיצוניים בצורה מאובטחת, סטנדרטית וגמישה. במקום לכתוב אינטגרציות מותאמות לכל מערכת, MCP מציע שפה אחידה שמאפשרת למודלים כמו Claude להבין ולגשת לכלים ולנתונים חיצוניים.🎯 רציתי לנסות את זה בעצמיזה נושא מאוד חם עכשיו, והחלטתי שאם כבר אני צולל לתוך MCP – למה לא להוציא מזה גם ערך מוסף?אז בניתי שרת MCP שמתחבר ל-API של לינקדאין, אוסף משרות רלוונטיות, ומעביר אותן ל-Claude דרך Claude Desktop.בניתי את זה כך שיאפשר לי להזין פרומפט פשוט כמו ""חפש לי משרות Software Engineer Intern בישראל"", ו-Claude מבצע את כל התהליך – מחיפוש ועד הצגת המשרות – בצורה אוטומטית, נוחה ומרשימה.🛠️הטכנולוגיה מאחורי הקלעים:⚫ ה-MCP מאפשר ל-Claude לתקשר עם השרת שלי בצורה מאובטחת וסטנדרטית.⚫ הClaude Desktop משמש כ-host שמתווך בין ה-AI למקורות המידע.⚫ הכל בנוי בצורה מודולרית, כך שקל להוסיף תכונות חדשות ולשפר את החוויה.אם אתם מפתחים שמתעניינים באינטגרציה בין AI לעולם האמיתי, ממליץ לבדוק את MCP. ואם אתם במקרה מגייסים או מכירים משרה שיכולה להתאים –  אשמח לשמוע 😄🔗 למידע נוסף על MCP: https://lnkd.in/dTAmNBu8🔗 ניתן לראות הקוד לשרת באתר שלי: https://lnkd.in/dd32-iMf

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

The portfolio was impressive. But within 3 months, everything fell apart. WHY? I focused ONLY on technical skills and ignored CULTURE FIT. The result? Misaligned expectations, communication gaps, and a delayed project that hurt our reputation. LESSONS LEARNED: - Skills matter, but VALUES matter more - Time zones aren’t the biggest challenge—MINDSET is - A 30-minute culture interview saves months of headaches Now, we have a 3-step hiring framework that’s helped us build a rockstar team across 12 countries: 1. Skills test (obvious) 2. Culture alignment call (non-negotiable) 3. Trial project (real-world fit check) Remote work isn’t just about getting the job done.

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Igal BeilinIgal Beilin,,"ChatGPT knocked me out of my chair today!It appears it can now run code by itself!Today I asked GPT (actually several of them) to help me define and design my own website.I started off with my PM Co-Pilot GPT of course,I asked it to ask me a series of questions,that would help define a specificationfor my very own website.But that's the stuff for another post.The point is, that after defining the website spec, I wanted to see if it could build a basic mockup of it, before I go spending some hard-earned US dollars on no-code and website building tools.Quickly enough, ChatGPT started writing an html script in Canvas mode, and then it notified me it has a new feature: running the code in the Canvas (!)(I wasn't recording it so what you see here is a re-run without the notification).And boy! This is a game changer.There's no more need in installing IDEs or compilers.No more annoying messages to go run that script with Python.You can now write, simulate and test your web application without leaving ChatGPT.What do you think? Is this mind blowing or what?

Alexandru-Catalin DinisAlexandru-Catalin Dinis,,"I’m I’ve been diving deeper into Java performance tuning, and I came across this insightful article: “Java is very fast if you don’t create objects.” It really made me rethink how I write Java code, especially in systems where low-latency and high throughput are non-negotiable.The key takeaway? Object creation isn’t “free” — even with the JVM’s optimizations. Every allocation adds up, especially in performance-critical applications. The article does a great job of showing how reducing GC pressure by minimizing object creation can lead to significant performance gains.Some lessons I’m keeping in mind: •	Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths. •	Reuse objects where possible. •	Data structures and memory layout matter, even in Java. •	Sometimes, the “elegant” OO design isn’t the fastest — and that’s OK when performance is king.This doesn’t mean we should avoid all objects — Java is, after all, an object-oriented language. But being mindful of when and how we create them can lead to JVM performance that rivals native code.Full article can be found here, with a detailed analyze: https://lnkd.in/d3KASMZxhashtag#Java hashtag#Performance hashtag#JVM hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#LowLatency

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a Frame is a data structure created for each method call within a thread’s Java Stack. Each thread in the JVM has its own Java Stack, which is a region of memory used to manage method execution. Frames are the building blocks of this stack, acting as individual workspaces that store all the information needed to execute a method.A Frame consists of three main components:- Local Variable Array- Operand Stack- Constant Pool Reference𝙁𝙧𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙨 𝙘𝙖𝙣 𝙗𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙞𝙖𝙡𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙪𝙨𝙚𝙙 𝙗𝙮 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙅𝙄𝙏 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙚𝙧 𝙙𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙡-𝙘𝙖𝙡𝙡 𝙤𝙥𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙞𝙯𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣. In certain cases, when the JVM detects a tail-recursive method call, the JIT can overwrite the current Frame instead of pushing a new one, reducing stack growth and preventing StackOverflowError. This optimization, part of HotSpot’s advanced inlining, is rarely discussed but critical for high-performance recursive code.When compute(5, 3) is called:A Frame for compute is created, with local variables a (5), b (3), and sum (8), and an Operand Stack for a + b.When multiply(8) is called, a new Frame is pushed for multiply, with its own local variable x (8) and Operand Stack for x * 2.If multiply(-8) is called instead, an IllegalArgumentException occurs. The JVM uses the Frames to build a Stack Trace, showing the call chain: multiply → compute.hashtag#java hashtag#jvm

The system follows a publisher-subscriber model, where control commands are sent from a client interface to the HiveMQ server, which then relays them to the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 processes these messages and switches the LEDs on or off in real time.

Vikas KumarVikas Kumar,,"Randomization in UVM/SV testbenches is one of the best things —It allows us to generate corner cases that we might never think of manually! 🙂But the approach you take with randomization makes a big difference.I’ve seen two common styles:1. Randomly generate configuration and signal values in the test.Then in the scoreboard, you need to check what was received and figure out whether it’s correct or not.To do this, you often have to reverse-engineer your own test to understand what the expected behavior should’ve been — not fun!2. During randomization itself, you not only generate the config and signal values, but also check what mismatch or expected behavior you are introducing.You pass this expected result to the scoreboard, and now the scoreboard just has to sample what was received and compare it — no extra logic or reverse thinking needed.After some hard lessons with the first approach 🥲, I definitely prefer the second one now — makes debugging so much smoother!hashtag#uvm hashtag#systemverilog hashtag#coding hashtag#verilog hashtag#testbench hashtag#randomization hashtag#verification

Shubham KolarShubham Kolar,,"Ever Wondered What Makes HashSet in Java So Powerful?🤔Key Points about HashSet in Java:1. Unordered CollectionHashSet doesn’t maintain insertion order.Why? —> It uses hashing to decide where each element goes. 2. Hashing LogicIt applies this formula:hash(element.hashCode()) % capacityThis determines the bucket for storage.3. No Duplicates AllowedHashSet ensures uniqueness by checking the hash and .equals() methods.4. Internal StorageInternally backed by a HashMap — the key is your element, and the value is a constant dummy object.5. Initial Capacity: 166. Load Factor: 0.75 (75%)When 75% full, the capacity is doubled, e.g., from 16 → 32.7. RehashingAfter resizing, elements are rehashed and redistributed into new buckets. Costly operation, but improves lookup performance.8. Hash CollisionsIf two elements have the same hash, they’re stored in a linked list in the same bucket.9. Treeify (Java 8 Feature)If a single bucket has > 8 collisions, the list is converted to a balanced tree → Faster lookups, even with collisions!HashSet = Fast, unique, no order, and smart handling of collisions!hashtag#Java hashtag#HashSet hashtag#CollectionsFramework hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#CodingConcepts hashtag#InterviewQuestion
