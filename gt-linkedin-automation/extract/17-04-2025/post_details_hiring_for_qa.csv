What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

Mevawala ShahbazkhanMevawala Shahbazkhan,,"QC, QA, or TQM? What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture

Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2.

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture

Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture

What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture

Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2.

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture

What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture

Mevawala ShahbazkhanMevawala Shahbazkhan,,"QC, QA, or TQM? What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture

Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2.

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture

Mevawala ShahbazkhanMevawala Shahbazkhan,,"QC, QA, or TQM? What’s the REAL difference?Most people even professionals use these terms interchangeably—but in reality, they define entirely different approaches to quality, productivity and excellence in the industry.—Here’s a quick breakdown that every engineer, manager, and recruiter should know.1. Quality Control (QC):→ Think of it as the “hashtag#Gatekeeper”Purpose: Detect & fix defectsFocus: ProductResponsibility: Inspectors & QC Team2. Quality Assurance (QA):→ The “hashtag#Process hashtag#Guardian”Purpose: Prevent defects before they happenFocus: ProcessResponsibility: Cross-functional QA Team3. Total Quality Management (TQM):→ The “hashtag#Culture hashtag#of hashtag#Quality”Purpose: Continuous improvement & customer delightFocus: Whole OrganizationResponsibility: Everyone—from top management to shop floor peoples!Why does it matter?Understanding these terms is more than theory—it shows you speak the language of operations, leadership, and customer value.Who gets this right doesn’t just reduce defects—they build trust, efficiency, and a brand customers believe in.I’ve applied these concepts to real-world scenarios in QA & QC management, and trust me—they make a difference on the floor.Let’s build products that speak quality from Day 1—not just at the final check.hashtag#QAQC hashtag#ShahbazTalks hashtag#QualityControl hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#TQM hashtag#ManufacturingExcellence hashtag#ProcessImprovement hashtag#Lean hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearchWhich one do you focus on in your company?

Abraão Luís RosaAbraão Luís Rosa,,"Does your team have Testers or QAs?This question says a lot about your development maturity.In agile development, the distinction between a Software Tester and a Quality Assurance (QA) professional directly impacts your team’s efficiency, quality, and delivery speed.Testers usually focus on executing functional tests after development is complete.They validate acceptance criteria and report defects.But QAs play a much more strategic role: •	Participate early in backlog refinement and planning. •	Influence the development process through TDD, BDD, shift-left testing, and continuous automation. •	Monitor quality metrics, test coverage, and potential risk areas.While a Tester works on the “output”, a QA focuses on the “cause.”And the market is evolving fast:High-performing teams have QAs who ensure quality is built in, not just tested in.What about your team? Is quality treated as everyone’s responsibility, or just the tester’s?Let’s exchange insights in the comments!hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#QAEngineer hashtag#SoftwareTesting hashtag#ShiftLeft hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AgileDevelopment hashtag#TDD hashtag#BDD hashtag#TestingStrategy hashtag#TestAutomation hashtag#QualityCulture
