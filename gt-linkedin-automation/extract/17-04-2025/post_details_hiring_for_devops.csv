The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

Despite attending multiple interviews, most feedback pointed to a lack of skills. It was disheartening, but I didn’t give up.To support my family, I started working as a delivery executive (Shadowfax, Flipkart) during the day, and at night, I upskilled myself with free YouTube tutorials and Udemy courses.Here’s what I’ve learned so far:  ✅ Git & GitHub ✅ Docker & Chef ✅ Maven ✅ AWS (EC2, S3 – basics) ✅ Bash & Shell Scripting ✅ Python (basics) ✅ CI/CD Concepts ✅ Linux Commands & Monitoring (top, df, netstat, iostat, etc.)Even after long delivery shifts, I practiced real-time scenarios and built small automation scripts. My drive to grow didn't stop.🧑‍💻 Past Work Experience:System Engineer at Spark Minda Technical Centre, Pune – 2 yearsCAD Infrastructure DevOps Engineer at AMD – 1 year 2 months🔧 Projects:AWS Resource Listing Automation (Bash & Python)CI/CD Pipeline AutomationI support my wife, elderly father, and brother and his family. My father continues to work despite health issues. The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud.

My drive to grow didn't stop.🧑‍💻 Past Work Experience:System Engineer at Spark Minda Technical Centre, Pune – 2 yearsCAD Infrastructure DevOps Engineer at AMD – 1 year 2 months🔧 Projects:AWS Resource Listing Automation (Bash & Python)CI/CD Pipeline AutomationI support my wife, elderly father, and brother and his family. My father continues to work despite health issues. The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud. If you are interested in what makes Palette different, this page is a great place to begin: https://okt.to/DkCTYiWe believe this is the future of infrastructure automation, and we are just getting started.

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud. If you are interested in what makes Palette different, this page is a great place to begin: https://okt.to/DkCTYiWe believe this is the future of infrastructure automation, and we are just getting started.

Egor KaleynikEgor Kaleynik,,"Most of the lead scorings are broken. Here’s how to unbreak themLet’s be real: most lead scoring models feel like horoscopes dressed up in spreadsheets. ""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below. I'll help you rebuild your scoring framework based on your purposes.hashtag#leadscoring hashtag#salesstrategy hashtag#b2bsaas hashtag#revops hashtag#demandgen

The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud.

Egor KaleynikEgor Kaleynik,,"Most of the lead scorings are broken. Here’s how to unbreak themLet’s be real: most lead scoring models feel like horoscopes dressed up in spreadsheets. ""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below. I'll help you rebuild your scoring framework based on your purposes.hashtag#leadscoring hashtag#salesstrategy hashtag#b2bsaas hashtag#revops hashtag#demandgen

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud.

Egor KaleynikEgor Kaleynik,,"Most of the lead scorings are broken. Here’s how to unbreak themLet’s be real: most lead scoring models feel like horoscopes dressed up in spreadsheets. ""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below. I'll help you rebuild your scoring framework based on your purposes.hashtag#leadscoring hashtag#salesstrategy hashtag#b2bsaas hashtag#revops hashtag#demandgen

While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud.

Egor KaleynikEgor Kaleynik,,"Most of the lead scorings are broken. Here’s how to unbreak themLet’s be real: most lead scoring models feel like horoscopes dressed up in spreadsheets. ""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below. I'll help you rebuild your scoring framework based on your purposes.hashtag#leadscoring hashtag#salesstrategy hashtag#b2bsaas hashtag#revops hashtag#demandgen

It was disheartening, but I didn’t give up.To support my family, I started working as a delivery executive (Shadowfax, Flipkart) during the day, and at night, I upskilled myself with free YouTube tutorials and Udemy courses.Here’s what I’ve learned so far:  ✅ Git & GitHub ✅ Docker & Chef ✅ Maven ✅ AWS (EC2, S3 – basics) ✅ Bash & Shell Scripting ✅ Python (basics) ✅ CI/CD Concepts ✅ Linux Commands & Monitoring (top, df, netstat, iostat, etc.)Even after long delivery shifts, I practiced real-time scenarios and built small automation scripts. My drive to grow didn't stop.🧑‍💻 Past Work Experience:System Engineer at Spark Minda Technical Centre, Pune – 2 yearsCAD Infrastructure DevOps Engineer at AMD – 1 year 2 months🔧 Projects:AWS Resource Listing Automation (Bash & Python)CI/CD Pipeline AutomationI support my wife, elderly father, and brother and his family. My father continues to work despite health issues. The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance. Even an entry-level position would mean a lot for me and my family.🔗 LinkedIn : https://lnkd.in/gJC__2Yb  💻 GitHub : https://lnkd.in/gC2RhUkE  📞 +91 9886639470 / 7066831187Thank you for reading this far. 🙏 Please like, comment, or share to help this reach someone who might be able to help.""May Allah ease the hardships of those facing illness, unemployment, financial struggles, and other challenges.""Sincerely,Abdulqayyum BaigumpalliTata Consultancy Services (TCS)InfosysWiproHCLTechTech MahindraCognizantCapgeminiLTIMindtreePersistent SystemsBirlasoftZohoZerodhaRazorpayBrowserStackPostmanSwiggyFlipkartPhonePeHashiCorpInfraCloud TechnologiesDevtron Inc.HarnessOpsTree SolutionsGeekyAntsHashedIn by DeloitteAmagiKloud9 LLCAmazon Web Services (AWS)Google Cloud SecurityMicrosoftIBMOracleDell TechnologiesNVIDIAAMDIntel CorporationSiemens Digital Industries SoftwareScalerNaukri.comDEVOPS INSTITUTE

""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below.

My drive to grow didn't stop.🧑‍💻 Past Work Experience:System Engineer at Spark Minda Technical Centre, Pune – 2 yearsCAD Infrastructure DevOps Engineer at AMD – 1 year 2 months🔧 Projects:AWS Resource Listing Automation (Bash & Python)CI/CD Pipeline AutomationI support my wife, elderly father, and brother and his family. My father continues to work despite health issues. The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud.

""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below.

Venkata Sai Tirumala Naidu ThumatiVenkata Sai Tirumala Naidu Thumati,,"Ever wonder why some companies shortlist candidates, schedule interviews, even say “we’ll move forward”… and then completely go silent?In the past few months, I’ve seen a pattern — you go through one or two rounds (sometimes even three), the feedback seems positive, you're told they’ll be in touch for next steps... and then weeks pass by with no update.It’s tough — as candidates, we prepare hard, invest time, and remain hopeful, only to be left in the dark. Sometimes we never hear back, not even after two months.This isn’t about calling out anyone — it’s about raising awareness. A simple “yes” or “no” helps candidates move forward with clarity. Communication makes all the difference.To all the recruiters and hiring managers who do keep candidates informed: thank you — it truly means a lot.And to my fellow job seekers: stay strong, stay consistent.

The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud.

Egor KaleynikEgor Kaleynik,,"Most of the lead scorings are broken. Here’s how to unbreak themLet’s be real: most lead scoring models feel like horoscopes dressed up in spreadsheets. ""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below. I'll help you rebuild your scoring framework based on your purposes.hashtag#leadscoring hashtag#salesstrategy hashtag#b2bsaas hashtag#revops hashtag#demandgen

Venkata Sai Tirumala Naidu ThumatiVenkata Sai Tirumala Naidu Thumati,,"Ever wonder why some companies shortlist candidates, schedule interviews, even say “we’ll move forward”… and then completely go silent?In the past few months, I’ve seen a pattern — you go through one or two rounds (sometimes even three), the feedback seems positive, you're told they’ll be in touch for next steps... and then weeks pass by with no update.It’s tough — as candidates, we prepare hard, invest time, and remain hopeful, only to be left in the dark. Sometimes we never hear back, not even after two months.This isn’t about calling out anyone — it’s about raising awareness. A simple “yes” or “no” helps candidates move forward with clarity. Communication makes all the difference.To all the recruiters and hiring managers who do keep candidates informed: thank you — it truly means a lot.And to my fellow job seekers: stay strong, stay consistent.

Despite attending multiple interviews, most feedback pointed to a lack of skills. It was disheartening, but I didn’t give up.To support my family, I started working as a delivery executive (Shadowfax, Flipkart) during the day, and at night, I upskilled myself with free YouTube tutorials and Udemy courses.Here’s what I’ve learned so far:  ✅ Git & GitHub ✅ Docker & Chef ✅ Maven ✅ AWS (EC2, S3 – basics) ✅ Bash & Shell Scripting ✅ Python (basics) ✅ CI/CD Concepts ✅ Linux Commands & Monitoring (top, df, netstat, iostat, etc.)Even after long delivery shifts, I practiced real-time scenarios and built small automation scripts. My drive to grow didn't stop.🧑‍💻 Past Work Experience:System Engineer at Spark Minda Technical Centre, Pune – 2 yearsCAD Infrastructure DevOps Engineer at AMD – 1 year 2 months🔧 Projects:AWS Resource Listing Automation (Bash & Python)CI/CD Pipeline AutomationI support my wife, elderly father, and brother and his family. My father continues to work despite health issues. The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud. If you are interested in what makes Palette different, this page is a great place to begin: https://okt.to/DkCTYiWe believe this is the future of infrastructure automation, and we are just getting started.

""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below.

Venkata Sai Tirumala Naidu ThumatiVenkata Sai Tirumala Naidu Thumati,,"Ever wonder why some companies shortlist candidates, schedule interviews, even say “we’ll move forward”… and then completely go silent?In the past few months, I’ve seen a pattern — you go through one or two rounds (sometimes even three), the feedback seems positive, you're told they’ll be in touch for next steps... and then weeks pass by with no update.It’s tough — as candidates, we prepare hard, invest time, and remain hopeful, only to be left in the dark. Sometimes we never hear back, not even after two months.This isn’t about calling out anyone — it’s about raising awareness. A simple “yes” or “no” helps candidates move forward with clarity. Communication makes all the difference.To all the recruiters and hiring managers who do keep candidates informed: thank you — it truly means a lot.And to my fellow job seekers: stay strong, stay consistent. The right opportunity will come. 💪hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#DevOps hashtag#HiringTransparency hashtag#AWS hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform

Abdulqayyum (アブドゥルかゆム) BaigumpalliAbdulqayyum (アブドゥルかゆム) Baigumpalli,,"🚨 Urgently Seeking Job Opportunity – IT or Non-IT | Open to Any Location 🚨Dear HRs, Recruiters, and Hiring Managers,,My name is Abdulqayyum Baigumpalli, and I’m urgently looking for any job opportunity, whether IT or Non-IT.After my last role ended 1.4 years ago, life has tested me in every possible way – financially, mentally, and emotionally. Despite attending multiple interviews, most feedback pointed to a lack of skills. It was disheartening, but I didn’t give up.To support my family, I started working as a delivery executive (Shadowfax, Flipkart) during the day, and at night, I upskilled myself with free YouTube tutorials and Udemy courses.Here’s what I’ve learned so far:  ✅ Git & GitHub ✅ Docker & Chef ✅ Maven ✅ AWS (EC2, S3 – basics) ✅ Bash & Shell Scripting ✅ Python (basics) ✅ CI/CD Concepts ✅ Linux Commands & Monitoring (top, df, netstat, iostat, etc.)Even after long delivery shifts, I practiced real-time scenarios and built small automation scripts. My drive to grow didn't stop.🧑‍💻 Past Work Experience:System Engineer at Spark Minda Technical Centre, Pune – 2 yearsCAD Infrastructure DevOps Engineer at AMD – 1 year 2 months🔧 Projects:AWS Resource Listing Automation (Bash & Python)CI/CD Pipeline AutomationI support my wife, elderly father, and brother and his family. My father continues to work despite health issues. The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance. Even an entry-level position would mean a lot for me and my family.🔗 LinkedIn : https://lnkd.in/gJC__2Yb  💻 GitHub : https://lnkd.in/gC2RhUkE  📞 +91 9886639470 / 7066831187Thank you for reading this far. 🙏 Please like, comment, or share to help this reach someone who might be able to help.""May Allah ease the hardships of those facing illness, unemployment, financial struggles, and other challenges.""Sincerely,Abdulqayyum BaigumpalliTata Consultancy Services (TCS)InfosysWiproHCLTechTech MahindraCognizantCapgeminiLTIMindtreePersistent SystemsBirlasoftZohoZerodhaRazorpayBrowserStackPostmanSwiggyFlipkartPhonePeHashiCorpInfraCloud TechnologiesDevtron Inc.HarnessOpsTree SolutionsGeekyAntsHashedIn by DeloitteAmagiKloud9 LLCAmazon Web Services (AWS)Google Cloud SecurityMicrosoftIBMOracleDell TechnologiesNVIDIAAMDIntel CorporationSiemens Digital Industries SoftwareScalerNaukri.comDEVOPS INSTITUTE

While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud. If you are interested in what makes Palette different, this page is a great place to begin: https://okt.to/DkCTYiWe believe this is the future of infrastructure automation, and we are just getting started.

""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below.

Venkata Sai Tirumala Naidu ThumatiVenkata Sai Tirumala Naidu Thumati,,"Ever wonder why some companies shortlist candidates, schedule interviews, even say “we’ll move forward”… and then completely go silent?In the past few months, I’ve seen a pattern — you go through one or two rounds (sometimes even three), the feedback seems positive, you're told they’ll be in touch for next steps... and then weeks pass by with no update.It’s tough — as candidates, we prepare hard, invest time, and remain hopeful, only to be left in the dark. Sometimes we never hear back, not even after two months.This isn’t about calling out anyone — it’s about raising awareness. A simple “yes” or “no” helps candidates move forward with clarity. Communication makes all the difference.To all the recruiters and hiring managers who do keep candidates informed: thank you — it truly means a lot.And to my fellow job seekers: stay strong, stay consistent.

The emotional and financial pressure is immense, and I’m doing everything I can to turn things around.I am open to any job (IT/Non-IT) and any location, including: 📍 Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, or Kanyakumari.If you or someone in your network knows of an opportunity, I humbly request your support, referral, or guidance.

Amarjeet S.Amarjeet S.,,"One of the most powerful capabilities in Palette is its declarative management across the entire Kubernetes stack. While many platforms focus only on initial infrastructure provisioning, Palette extends automation across all layers, from the operating system to integrations. At the core of this approach is a robust implementation of the CNCF Cluster API. With Cluster Profiles, teams can define reusable and composable stacks that are continuously reconciled and self-healing throughout their lifecycle.This level of automation is a key reason why organizations choose Spectro Cloud.

Egor KaleynikEgor Kaleynik,,"Most of the lead scorings are broken. Here’s how to unbreak themLet’s be real: most lead scoring models feel like horoscopes dressed up in spreadsheets. ""10+ job listings? Score: 70."" ""Marketing director viewed a whitepaper? Score: 40."" ""ICP match with a pulse? Score: 85.""You know what all of that tells you? Nothing useful. Because scoring off firmographics and content clicks is like predicting rainfall from the color of the sky. You’re not wrong but you’re definitely not right either.The real buying signal isn’t who they are. It’s how they work.Here’s the shift:Don’t score accounts by titles. Score them by tension inside the team.That's what I'm talking about: 5+ vendor managers for a 20-person dev team 10 open engineering roles, but no in-house tech recruiter A CTO from Cognizant, and no DevOps hire in sight- These are buying signals hiding in plain sight.I threw out firmographic fluff and rebuilt a model that:- Flags structural gaps before job posts ever go live- Scores based on hiring logic and role distribution, not surface metrics- Tells sales why the account needs help, not just that they match ICPWho this is for:- GTM teams tired of chasing ghost MQLs- RevOps folks sick of scoring models that don’t reflect reality- Founders doing outbound and wondering why nothing sticksIf your lead scoring feels like a checkbox ritual, drop “score me” below. I'll help you rebuild your scoring framework based on your purposes.hashtag#leadscoring hashtag#salesstrategy hashtag#b2bsaas hashtag#revops hashtag#demandgen

Venkata Sai Tirumala Naidu ThumatiVenkata Sai Tirumala Naidu Thumati,,"Ever wonder why some companies shortlist candidates, schedule interviews, even say “we’ll move forward”… and then completely go silent?In the past few months, I’ve seen a pattern — you go through one or two rounds (sometimes even three), the feedback seems positive, you're told they’ll be in touch for next steps... and then weeks pass by with no update.It’s tough — as candidates, we prepare hard, invest time, and remain hopeful, only to be left in the dark. Sometimes we never hear back, not even after two months.This isn’t about calling out anyone — it’s about raising awareness. A simple “yes” or “no” helps candidates move forward with clarity. Communication makes all the difference.To all the recruiters and hiring managers who do keep candidates informed: thank you — it truly means a lot.And to my fellow job seekers: stay strong, stay consistent.
