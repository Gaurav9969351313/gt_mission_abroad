Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap.

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap. Win-win!Anyone else find themselves explaining APIs at parties only to watch everyone suddenly remember they need another drink? 😂hashtag#TechHumor hashtag#APIlife hashtag#DeveloperProblems hashtag#TheInternetIsMagic hashtag#RESTforSuccess

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Hatem MamdouhHatem Mamdouh,,"هنتكلم عن الفرق بين طريقتين مهمين جدا فى ال authentication  لل Api requests فى ال postman هما ال( OAuth1.0, OAuth2.0)1- OAuth1.0:باختصار هو بيساعدك  انك تنقل البيانات مع كذا consumer ,برضو فى نفس الوقت بيساعدك فى الحفاظ على بياناتك الشخصيه زى ال username, password  تعالى نعرف الكلام دا بيتم ازاى1- ال consumer  دا بيبعت request عشان ياخد ال access token 2- ال access token بيتكون من (secret ,key) دا بيجيبه من خلال ال service provider 3- ال service provider بيرجعله بال access token 4- ال consumer بعد ما حصل على ال access token ، يقدر يعمل access لل data بتاعه ال user السؤال :  دلوقتي انا بعد ما عملت كل دا اعرف ازاى أن ال authentication دا اتنفذ تمام على ال request دى ؟ الاجابه : هو أن بعد ما ضفت ال authentication فى ال request وعملت send لل request ، هتظهر  authentication details فى ال header بتاع ال response السؤال : ال OAuth دا بضيفه فين فى ال request ؟ الاجابه :  انا ممكن اضيفه فى ال query Parameters أو ال request header2- OAuth2.0:هو انك بعد ما خدت ال access token من ال service provider بتستخدمه عشان تعمل request a new access token عشان تقدر تعمل authenticate لل future requests تعالى نعرف الكلام دا بيتم ازاى1- ال consumer فى الاول بيبعت request عشان ياخد ال access token 2- ال access token بيتكون من (secret ,key) دا بيجيبه من خلال ال service provider 3- ال service provider بيرجعله بال access token وال refresh access token 4- ال consumer بعد ما حصل على ال access token ، يقدر يعمل access لل data بتاعه ال user 5- بعد ما ال access token يحصله expire ،ال user بيستخدم ال refresh access token  عشان يقدر يعمل authenticate لل future requests السؤال: ايه الفائده من استخدام ال OAuth 2.0؟ الاجابه : هو أن ال access token اللى حصلت عليه فى الأول من ال service provider هو يعتبر short-lived token، سعتها مش هقدر اعمل authentication لكل ال requests اللى عايز ابعتها بعد كدا ، الحل هو أن أستخدم ال OAuth2.0  ، لان دا بيساعدك أن لما ال access token يحصله expire , سعتها اقدر اعمل request a new access token من ال service provider ، عشان اقدر اعمل authentication لل requests اللى هبعتها بعد كدا السؤال: هل اقدر اعمل share لل token دا مع كذا حد ؟ الاجابه : اه اقدر اعمل كدا ، ودا يعتبر من فوائد ال OAuth2.0 ، من خلال انى اعمل turn on Share access token  السؤال:هل ينفع اخلى ال token يحصله auto-refresh لوحده ؟ الاجابه : turn on Auto-refresh access token ،دا  هيعمل auto generate a new access token ،دا يعتبر من فوائد ال OAuth 2.0سؤال : مين احسن ال OAuth1.0 ولا OAuth2.0 ؟الاجابه : طبعا ال OAuth 2.0 احسن ، لانه بيساعد انه  auto generate refresh access token , لو ال access token حصله expired ، دا بالتالى بيساعدك انك تعمل authentication لل any future Api requests

Ahmed ElfalakyAhmed Elfalaky,,"‎النهارده هنتكلم عنملفات SCL (Substation Configuration Language) هي حجر الأساس في automation المحطات الكهربائية‎ملفات ال scl ‎ملفات SCL هي ملفات بصيغة XML بتوصف مكونات وإعدادات نظام ال automation في المحطة الكهربائية بطريقة موحدة. الملفات دي بتخلينا ننقل المعلومات والإعدادات بين الأجهزة والبرامج من مختلف الشركات المصنعة بسهولة، وده اللي بيخلي التوافق بين الأنظمة المختلفة ممكن.‎أنواع ملفات SCL‎1. ملف SSD (System Specification Description)‎ده الملف اللي بيوصف البنية الأساسية للنظام الكهربائي المطلوب عمل automation. بنستخدمه في بداية المشروع عشان نحدد: •	شكل شبكة المحطة الكهربائية (Single Line Diagram) •	الوظائف المطلوبة (Logical Nodes) من غير ما نحدد الأجهزة اللي هتنفذها •	مواصفات النظام بشكل عام من الناحية الوظيفية‎الملف ده بيبقى فيه أقسام الـ Substation والـ Data Type Templates وتعريفات الـ Logical Node Types، بس مش بيكون محتاج قسم الـ IED عشان لسه منحددناش الأجهزة بالظبط.‎2. ملف ICD (IED Capabilities Description)‎ده الملف اللي بيوصف إمكانيات الجهاز (IED) وبيبقى متوفر من الشركة المصنعة للجهاز. الملف ده بيحتوي على: •	قسم واحد للـ IED بيوصف كل إمكانيات الجهاز •	أقسام اختيارية للـ Communication •	أقسام اختيارية للـ Substation بتوضح الكيانات الفيزيائية المرتبطة بالجهاز‎يعني ببساطة، ده كتالوج إلكتروني كامل عن الجهاز وكل حاجة ممكن يعملها. ده بيبقى الأساس اللي بنبني عليه نظام الـ IEC 61850 بتاعنا.‎3. ملف SCD (Substation Configuration Description)‎ده أهم ملف في النظام كله، عشان بيحتوي على ال configuration الكامل للنظام بتاعنا. الملف ده بيشمل: •	العلاقة مع البنية الكهربائية للمحطة‎الملف ده بينتج من دمج ملف الـ SSD مع ملفات الـ ICD للأجهزة المختلفة. ده الملف اللي بنستخدمه لإدارة النظام بالكامل، وعشان كده PcVue وأنظمة SCADA التانية بتوصي باستخدامه.‎4. ملف CID (Configured IED Description)‎ده ملف بيخص جهاز واحد فقط بعد ما تم تكوينه. ممكن نعتبره نسخة مصغرة من ملف الـ SCD فيها بس المعلومات اللي الجهاز محتاجها عشان يشتغل. بيحتوي على: •	معلومات الـ GOOSE messages اللي الجهاز بينشرها •	المعلومات المتاحة للعملاء المختلفين‎ده الملف اللي بنحمله على الجهاز في النهاية عشان يعرف دوره في النظام الكامل.‎5. ملف IID (Instantiated IED Description)‎ده ملف بيتولد بواسطة أداة هندسة الـ IED بعد تكوين اشتراكات الـ GOOSE وتعيين الإشارات للمنطق الداخلي. بيحتوي على: •	قسم واحد للـ IED ‎ده بيكون ملف وسيط بين أداة تكوين الجهاز وأداة تكوين النظام، يعني بيسهل عملية التكامل بين الأدوات المختلفة.‎6. ملف SED (System Exchange Description)‎ده ملف بيستخدم لتبادل معلومات النظام بين أدوات هندسية مختلفة. مش مذكور بالتفصيل في المعيار زي باقي الملفات، لكن بيلعب دور مهم في تبادل ال configuration بين الشركات المختلفة.‎العلاقة بين الملفات والتطبيق العملي‎لو عايزين نفهم سير العمل : 1.	بنبدأ بملف SSD اللي بيوصف المحطة ومتطلباتها الوظيفية 2.	بناخد ملفات ICD من مختلف الموردين للأجهزة 3.	بندمجهم في ملف SCD واحد بيوصف النظام كله 4.	بنستخرج ملفات CID للأجهزة الفردية 5.	كل جهاز بيتحمل عليه ملف الـ CID بتاعه‎عملياً، بنستخدم أدوات زي PcVue عشان نضيف ملفات SCL لتكوين شبكة IEC 61850 ونحدد عناصر التكوين المختلفة زي الأجهزة ومجموعات البيانات.

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap. Win-win!Anyone else find themselves explaining APIs at parties only to watch everyone suddenly remember they need another drink? 😂hashtag#TechHumor hashtag#APIlife hashtag#DeveloperProblems hashtag#TheInternetIsMagic hashtag#RESTforSuccess

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap. Win-win!Anyone else find themselves explaining APIs at parties only to watch everyone suddenly remember they need another drink? 😂hashtag#TechHumor hashtag#APIlife hashtag#DeveloperProblems hashtag#TheInternetIsMagic hashtag#RESTforSuccess

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap. Win-win!Anyone else find themselves explaining APIs at parties only to watch everyone suddenly remember they need another drink? 😂hashtag#TechHumor hashtag#APIlife hashtag#DeveloperProblems hashtag#TheInternetIsMagic hashtag#RESTforSuccess

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap. Win-win!Anyone else find themselves explaining APIs at parties only to watch everyone suddenly remember they need another drink? 😂hashtag#TechHumor hashtag#APIlife hashtag#DeveloperProblems hashtag#TheInternetIsMagic hashtag#RESTforSuccess

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap. Win-win!Anyone else find themselves explaining APIs at parties only to watch everyone suddenly remember they need another drink? 😂hashtag#TechHumor hashtag#APIlife hashtag#DeveloperProblems hashtag#TheInternetIsMagic hashtag#RESTforSuccess

Ankit SinghAnkit Singh,,"🧡 Why We Love Postman (and Why You Should Too!) 🚀Just finished testing my backend API using Postman, and once again — I'm reminded why it's an absolute essential in every developer’s toolkit. Whether you're a backend pro or just starting out, Postman makes API testing feel effortless.💡 What makes Postman so awesome?✅ Beginner-Friendly Interface — No terminal fear! Just enter your URL, choose the method (GET, POST...), add your body, and hit Send.✅ Clear Visual Feedback — Instantly see your response, headers, status code, and errors in one place. No more guessing what's going wrong.✅ Collections & Environment Setup — Save your API calls, switch between environments (dev/staging/production) like a pro.✅ Great for Collaboration — Easily share your APIs with teammates and test together.✅ Perfect for Learning — If you're learning backend or full-stack development, Postman is your best friend. It teaches you how requests/responses really work.📌 In the screenshot below, I’m testing a simple POST login API using a JSON body — and it takes just seconds to check if things are working.🧠 Pro Tip for Beginners: If you're building authentication, CRUD operations, or just want to test your Express API routes — try Postman. You'll learn faster, debug better, and feel more confident. 💪Let’s give a big shoutout to tools that make learning fun and powerful! 💬 Do you use Postman?

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Language Skills✅ طبعًا الـ English بقى مش رفاهية... ده أساسي! ليه؟ لأن:أغلب مصادر علم الـ HR أجنبيةبتفتح لك فرص أكبر في السوق بتميزك في المقابلات والاجتماعات وكمان مهم تطوّر نفسك في Business English 💼، وده يشمل: مصطلحات زي:ROIBusiness ModelComplianceالفرق بين Stakeholder و Shareholderالفرق بين Efficiency و Effectiveness  وغيرهم كتير جدا كل ده بيزوّد الحصيلة اللغوية وبيفرق معاك في حضور اجتماعات أو سيمينارات أو حتى كتابة إيميل احترافي.  💻 2. Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap. Win-win!Anyone else find themselves explaining APIs at parties only to watch everyone suddenly remember they need another drink? 😂hashtag#TechHumor hashtag#APIlife hashtag#DeveloperProblems hashtag#TheInternetIsMagic hashtag#RESTforSuccess

Ankit SinghAnkit Singh,,"🧡 Why We Love Postman (and Why You Should Too!) 🚀Just finished testing my backend API using Postman, and once again — I'm reminded why it's an absolute essential in every developer’s toolkit. Whether you're a backend pro or just starting out, Postman makes API testing feel effortless.💡 What makes Postman so awesome?✅ Beginner-Friendly Interface — No terminal fear! Just enter your URL, choose the method (GET, POST...), add your body, and hit Send.✅ Clear Visual Feedback — Instantly see your response, headers, status code, and errors in one place. No more guessing what's going wrong.✅ Collections & Environment Setup — Save your API calls, switch between environments (dev/staging/production) like a pro.✅ Great for Collaboration — Easily share your APIs with teammates and test together.✅ Perfect for Learning — If you're learning backend or full-stack development, Postman is your best friend. It teaches you how requests/responses really work.📌 In the screenshot below, I’m testing a simple POST login API using a JSON body — and it takes just seconds to check if things are working.🧠 Pro Tip for Beginners: If you're building authentication, CRUD operations, or just want to test your Express API routes — try Postman. You'll learn faster, debug better, and feel more confident. 💪Let’s give a big shoutout to tools that make learning fun and powerful! 💬 Do you use Postman?

Amr AtefAmr Atef,,"📡 OSPF مقابل EIGRP – مقارنة تفصيلية بين بروتوكولي توجيه رئيسيينسواء كنت مهندس شبكات و لسه بتبدأ أو ماسك شبكه كبيره ومعقده،أكيد سألت نفسك السؤال ده قبل كدا: أستخدم OSPF ولا EIGRP؟في المنشور ده، هنحلل الاختلافات بين  البروتوكولين من جميع الجوانب 👇⚙ نوع بروتوكول التوجيه:OSPF:🔸 بروتوكول حالة الرابط (Link-State Protocol)🔸 كل جهاز توجيه يبني خريطة كاملة للشبكة باستخدام إعلانات حالة الرابط (LSAs). تخيل أن كل راوتر لديه صورة كاملة عن كيفية اتصال جميع الأجهزة في الشبكة.EIGRP:🔹 بروتوكول متقدم لمتجهات المسافة (Advanced Distance Vector Protocol)🔹 يركز فقط على أجهزة التوجيه المجاورة، ويحسب أفضل مسار باستخدام خوارزمية DUAL (خوارزمية التحديث المنتشر). تخيل أن كل راوتر يعرف فقط عن جيرانه المباشرين وكيفية الوصول إليهم.🧠 الخوارزمية:OSPF:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية دايجسترا (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) لحساب أقصر مسار (SPF). تخيل أنها مثل استخدام تطبيق خرائط للعثور على أقصر طريق للوصول إلى وجهتك.EIGRP:📌 يستخدم خوارزمية DUAL، مما يسمح بالتقارب السريع واستعادة المسار بسرعة. التقارب السريع يعني أن الشبكة يمكن أن تتكيف بسرعة مع التغييرات دون انقطاع كبير في الاتصال.🧮 المقاييس:OSPF:🔸 يعتمد على التكلفة (Cost) = 100 / عرض النطاق الترددي (Bandwidth).🔸 كلما زاد عرض النطاق الترددي، انخفضت التكلفة، مما يعني أن المسار الأسرع هو المفضل.EIGRP:🔹 يستخدم معادلة تأخذ في الاعتبار عرض النطاق الترددي + التأخير (Bandwidth + Delay).🔹 يسمح أيضًا بعوامل أخرى مثل الحمل والموثوقية (مقاييس قابلة للتعديل). هذا يجعله أكثر مرونة في تحديد أفضل مسار.🧩 تصميم الشبكة الهرمي:OSPF:🧭 يعمل مع المناطق (Areas) (يجب أن يكون هناك منطقة 0 – منطقة العمود الفقري). تقسيم الشبكة إلى مناطق يساعد في إدارة الشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.🧠 الأفضل للشبكات الكبيرة والمعقدة.EIGRP:🚫 لا يوجد مفهوم للمناطق.يعمل ضمن نظام مستقل واحد (AS Number). هذا يعني أنه عادة ما يستخدم داخل شبكة إدارية واحدة.🔄 آلية التحديث:OSPF:🔁 يقوم بتحديثات دورية (كل 30 دقيقة).📦 كل إعلان حالة رابط (LSA) له عمر افتراضي افتراضي (LSAge).EIGRP:⚡ يرسل تحديثات محفزة فقط. هذا يعني أنه يرسل تحديثات فقط عندما يحدث تغيير في الشبكة.✅ أكثر كفاءة في استخدام النطاق الترددي لأنه لا يرسل تحديثات غير ضرورية.🚀 سرعة التقارب:EIGRP:🔥 تقارب أسرع بفضل DUAL.يحتفظ دائمًا بمسار احتياطي (الخلف القابل للتطبيق - Feasible Successor). وجود مسار احتياطي جاهز يعني أنه يمكنه التبديل إليه بسرعة في حالة فشل المسار الأساسي.OSPF:⏳ أبطأ قليلاً؛ يحتاج إلى إعادة حساب شجرة SPF من الصفر عند حدوث تغيير.🔐 التوافق:OSPF:✅ معيار مفتوح – يعمل عبر جميع البائعين (Cisco، Juniper، Mikrotik، إلخ). هذا يجعله خيارًا جيدًا للشبكات التي تستخدم أجهزة من شركات مختلفة.EIGRP:⛔ كان خاصًا بشركة Cisco.✅ أصبح الآن مفتوحًا، ولكنه لا يزال يستخدم بشكل أساسي في بيئات Cisco.🧠 الخلاصة:✅ لو بتشتغل في بيئه فيها أجهزه من شركات مختلفه أو عندك شبكة كبيرة ومعقدة ⬅ OSPF هو الخيار الصحيح.✅ لو شغال في بيئة Cisco فقط ومحتاج تقارب سريع وأداء موثوق ⬅ EIGRP هو الحل الأمثل

Technical Skillsبعد ما جمعت الـ knowledge، جه وقت التطبيق العملي! 📌 ونصيحة: الـ Technical Skills مش هتتعلمها من كورسات لوحدها، ممكن تاخد فكرة في ورش العمل، لكن التطبيق والممارسة هم الأساس.💡 لو ماعندكش مدير يعلّمك، دور على Mentor يوجّهك، ينقّح شغلك، ويقولك الغلط فين.🔍 حسب تخصصك في الـ HR، فيه مهارات لازم تكون عندك:👤 لو انت Recruiter:إزاي تعمل Interviewإزاي تجهز Assessments 💰 لو انت شغال في Comp & Ben:إزاي تصمم Salary Structureإزاي تحدد Pay Scales📚 لو انت في Training & Development:إزاي تعمل TNA – Training Needs Analysisإزاي تصمم Training program ... وهكذا كل تخصص وله Technical Skills لازم تشتغل عليها.  🧠 وده كان الجزء الأول من الـ Skills، استنونا في البوست الجاي نكمل النوعين التانيين! 🔜

Api AccelerateApi Accelerate,,"REST APIs: The Unsung Heroes of the Internet 🦸‍♂️Ever wonder how your favorite apps talk to each other behind the scenes? It's not magic—it's REST APIs!Think of REST APIs as the friendly neighborhood translators of the internet. They're why your weather app knows it's raining, your food delivery app knows where your burger is, and your banking app knows how much money you've spent on coffee this month (no judgment here).Why I'm secretly in love with REST APIs:They're like LEGO blocks for the internet—snap different services together and build something amazingThey speak the universal language of HTTP (GET me a coffee, POST my thoughts on LinkedIn)They're the reason you can book a flight, order dinner, and check your email without switching devicesThey don't hold grudges or remember past conversations (they're stateless, which is actually a good thing!)My favorite part? When someone asks what I do, I can say ""I work with REST APIs"" and sound both incredibly technical and like I need a nap. Win-win!Anyone else find themselves explaining APIs at parties only to watch everyone suddenly remember they need another drink? 😂hashtag#TechHumor hashtag#APIlife hashtag#DeveloperProblems hashtag#TheInternetIsMagic hashtag#RESTforSuccess

Ankit SinghAnkit Singh,,"🧡 Why We Love Postman (and Why You Should Too!) 🚀Just finished testing my backend API using Postman, and once again — I'm reminded why it's an absolute essential in every developer’s toolkit. Whether you're a backend pro or just starting out, Postman makes API testing feel effortless.💡 What makes Postman so awesome?✅ Beginner-Friendly Interface — No terminal fear! Just enter your URL, choose the method (GET, POST...), add your body, and hit Send.✅ Clear Visual Feedback — Instantly see your response, headers, status code, and errors in one place. No more guessing what's going wrong.✅ Collections & Environment Setup — Save your API calls, switch between environments (dev/staging/production) like a pro.✅ Great for Collaboration — Easily share your APIs with teammates and test together.✅ Perfect for Learning — If you're learning backend or full-stack development, Postman is your best friend. It teaches you how requests/responses really work.📌 In the screenshot below, I’m testing a simple POST login API using a JSON body — and it takes just seconds to check if things are working.🧠 Pro Tip for Beginners: If you're building authentication, CRUD operations, or just want to test your Express API routes — try Postman. You'll learn faster, debug better, and feel more confident. 💪Let’s give a big shoutout to tools that make learning fun and powerful! 💬 Do you use Postman? What’s your favorite feature?hashtag#Postman hashtag#API hashtag#WebDevelopment hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#LearningToCode hashtag#CodingTools hashtag#FullStack hashtag#ExpressJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#BeginnersWelcome hashtag#PostmanLove
