"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office? Let’s discuss in the comments! 👇hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkFromCafe hashtag#DigitalMara hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WorkAnywhere hashtag#DevLife

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

A QSR outlet, a ticketing job, a customer service role in any NBFC, a front office role, would all be great for him. hashtag#kotakeducationfoundation and hashtag#tatastrives can help perhaps with some tech skills and soft skills and hard skills.

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

Federico Di MarcoFederico Di Marco,,"I studied Java at university and I have worked very little on Java projects in my work career, however I never liked its checked exception concept which forces every developer to manage or declare exceptions in every method making them unusable.Personally, I consider exceptions exceptional events which occur rarely (if the codebase is ""sound"") and which must be managed seldomly; most of the times exceptions have to propagate automatically up the call stack till top level exception handlers or even be left unmanaged and .NET/C++ works in this way.Looking at how a developer handles the exception is an easy way to spot if he is a Java man or not.hashtag#exception hashtag#management

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

Federico Di MarcoFederico Di Marco,,"I studied Java at university and I have worked very little on Java projects in my work career, however I never liked its checked exception concept which forces every developer to manage or declare exceptions in every method making them unusable.Personally, I consider exceptions exceptional events which occur rarely (if the codebase is ""sound"") and which must be managed seldomly; most of the times exceptions have to propagate automatically up the call stack till top level exception handlers or even be left unmanaged and .NET/C++ works in this way.Looking at how a developer handles the exception is an easy way to spot if he is a Java man or not.hashtag#exception hashtag#management

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look.

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

Federico Di MarcoFederico Di Marco,,"I studied Java at university and I have worked very little on Java projects in my work career, however I never liked its checked exception concept which forces every developer to manage or declare exceptions in every method making them unusable.Personally, I consider exceptions exceptional events which occur rarely (if the codebase is ""sound"") and which must be managed seldomly; most of the times exceptions have to propagate automatically up the call stack till top level exception handlers or even be left unmanaged and .NET/C++ works in this way.Looking at how a developer handles the exception is an easy way to spot if he is a Java man or not.hashtag#exception hashtag#management

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

Jay MahajanJay Mahajan,,"🚀 hashtag#Day51 of Learning Java! 🚀Super excited to share today's learnings about Inter-Thread Communication in Java! 🤝💡🔄 1. Inter-Thread Communication:Threads can communicate with each other using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods.🔹 wait() method:A thread that expects an update calls wait() and enters a waiting state until it gets notified.🔹 notify() method:The thread responsible for updating calls notify(), which wakes up the waiting thread so it can proceed with updated data.🔹 Locking Condition:A thread must hold the object's lock (i.e., be inside a synchronized block) to call wait(), notify(), or notifyAll().⚠️ 2. IllegalMonitorStateException:If we call wait(), notify(), or notifyAll() outside a Synchronized Block or Method, we get a runtime exception:IllegalMonitorStateException 🚨❓ 3. Why Are These Methods in Object Class & Not in Thread Class?Unlike start(), join(), and sleep(), which belong to Thread class, these methods are in Object class because they can be called on any Java object, not just threads.📝 Example: Just like messages can be delivered by a postman, teacher, or student, inter-thread communication methods can be used on any object! 📩🎓🖊 4. Method Declarations:✅ wait() Methods:👉🏻public final void wait() throws InterruptedException 👉🏻public final native void wait(long ms) throws InterruptedException 👉🏻public final void wait(long ms, int ns) throws InterruptedException✅ notify() Method:👉🏻public final native void notify()✅ notifyAll() Method:👉🏻public final native void notifyAll()hashtag#Java hashtag#Multithreading hashtag#Learning hashtag#Coding hashtag#InterThreadCommunication  hashtag#Durgasoft hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

"Stephanie Reinhardt, CHRSStephanie Reinhardt, CHRS",,"To all the overbearing managers who stifle creativity and productivity, refusing to allow your team the freedom of flexible schedules limits their potential. When you impose rigid working hours, you often overlook the unique rhythms that each individual has in their work habits. Many employees thrive in environments where they can choose when to tackle tasks, leading to improved focus and quality of work. By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look. It now includes 189 sites around the world that have successfully scaled intelligent automation and innovation. The latest report adds 36 new Lighthouses – nearly half are in Asia (about 30% in China), 25% in Europe, 10% in North America, and the first one has just launched in Africa.What really stands out is that “working smart” isn’t just about productivity. It’s about freeing up time – for your family, your growth, your side projects. Sure, efficiency matters. But quality of life? That’s the real ROI ✨ 👉 Full report here:

Federico Di MarcoFederico Di Marco,,"I studied Java at university and I have worked very little on Java projects in my work career, however I never liked its checked exception concept which forces every developer to manage or declare exceptions in every method making them unusable.Personally, I consider exceptions exceptional events which occur rarely (if the codebase is ""sound"") and which must be managed seldomly; most of the times exceptions have to propagate automatically up the call stack till top level exception handlers or even be left unmanaged and .NET/C++ works in this way.Looking at how a developer handles the exception is an easy way to spot if he is a Java man or not.hashtag#exception hashtag#management

Jay MahajanJay Mahajan,,"🚀 hashtag#Day51 of Learning Java! 🚀Super excited to share today's learnings about Inter-Thread Communication in Java! 🤝💡🔄 1. Inter-Thread Communication:Threads can communicate with each other using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods.🔹 wait() method:A thread that expects an update calls wait() and enters a waiting state until it gets notified.🔹 notify() method:The thread responsible for updating calls notify(), which wakes up the waiting thread so it can proceed with updated data.🔹 Locking Condition:A thread must hold the object's lock (i.e., be inside a synchronized block) to call wait(), notify(), or notifyAll().⚠️ 2. IllegalMonitorStateException:If we call wait(), notify(), or notifyAll() outside a Synchronized Block or Method, we get a runtime exception:IllegalMonitorStateException 🚨❓ 3. Why Are These Methods in Object Class & Not in Thread Class?Unlike start(), join(), and sleep(), which belong to Thread class, these methods are in Object class because they can be called on any Java object, not just threads.📝 Example: Just like messages can be delivered by a postman, teacher, or student, inter-thread communication methods can be used on any object! 📩🎓🖊 4. Method Declarations:✅ wait() Methods:👉🏻public final void wait() throws InterruptedException 👉🏻public final native void wait(long ms) throws InterruptedException 👉🏻public final void wait(long ms, int ns) throws InterruptedException✅ notify() Method:👉🏻public final native void notify()✅ notifyAll() Method:👉🏻public final native void notifyAll()hashtag#Java hashtag#Multithreading hashtag#Learning hashtag#Coding hashtag#InterThreadCommunication  hashtag#Durgasoft hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

By granting your team the autonomy to manage their schedules, you foster trust and empowerment, ultimately enhancing overall performance and job satisfaction.💫I once asked a manager why we couldn’t be remote anymore like another department, and they responded that our work is more detailed than theirs, implying our tasks were more important. 🙄However, at my job, we value every role equally. They just wanted to maintain control over the situation and limit remote work.Overshadowing a team's independence with relentless micromanagement can lead you down a fruitless path, ultimately risking the departure of your most valuable talent. When creativity and initiative are suppressed, the brightest minds may look for opportunities elsewhere, creating a challenging void to fill.This is a crucial topic, but I firmly believe that remote work reduces stress, boosts productivity, and sparks innovation. I thrive on a hybrid schedule—I enjoy the flexibility while relishing connecting with my coworkers in person! 🫱🏼‍🫲🏼As Huyuni said, “We’re saving PDFs, not lives.” 💼💻

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Yelnur MukhamedkarimYelnur Mukhamedkarim,,"☕ Work from a Café: Productivity Boost or Distraction? 💻The idea of working from a cozy café with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of conversation sounds like a dream. But is it really the best environment for software development? Let’s weigh the pros and cons!✅ Pros:🔹 Inspiration & Creativity – A change of scenery can spark new ideas and boost problem-solving skills.🔹 No Office Distractions – No impromptu meetings or office chatter—just you, your laptop, and a good cup of coffee.🔹 Networking Opportunities – You never know who you might meet! Cafés often attract freelancers, remote workers, and entrepreneurs.🔹 Flexibility & Comfort – Work at your own pace, take breaks when needed, and enjoy a relaxed atmosphere.⚠️ Cons:🔸 Unstable Wi-Fi – A slow or unreliable connection can disrupt coding and video calls.🔸 Noise Levels – Background chatter and loud music can make deep focus challenging.🔸 Security Risks – Public Wi-Fi networks pose cybersecurity threats; always use a VPN!🔸 Limited Ergonomics – Small tables and uncomfortable chairs aren’t ideal for long coding sessions.💡 Pro Tip: If you enjoy working from a café, noise-canceling headphones, a mobile hotspot, and an ergonomic setup can make the experience much smoother!Do you prefer working from a café, a co-working space, or a quiet home office?

Rafał GromadaRafał Gromada,,"Today, I had a truly inspiring conversation with Maria Gebarska about how we live and work in a world that’s constantly accelerating. We talked about what it really means to “work smart” – and how innovation can not only boost performance but also make our lives better.A few hours later, I came across the January report “Global Lighthouse Network: The Mindset Shifts Driving Impact and Scale in Digital Transformation” – and it couldn’t have been more on point. If you haven’t heard of the Global Lighthouse Network (launched by the World Economic Forum in 2018), it’s worth a look.

Jay MahajanJay Mahajan,,"🚀 hashtag#Day51 of Learning Java! 🚀Super excited to share today's learnings about Inter-Thread Communication in Java! 🤝💡🔄 1. Inter-Thread Communication:Threads can communicate with each other using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods.🔹 wait() method:A thread that expects an update calls wait() and enters a waiting state until it gets notified.🔹 notify() method:The thread responsible for updating calls notify(), which wakes up the waiting thread so it can proceed with updated data.🔹 Locking Condition:A thread must hold the object's lock (i.e., be inside a synchronized block) to call wait(), notify(), or notifyAll().⚠️ 2. IllegalMonitorStateException:If we call wait(), notify(), or notifyAll() outside a Synchronized Block or Method, we get a runtime exception:IllegalMonitorStateException 🚨❓ 3. Why Are These Methods in Object Class & Not in Thread Class?Unlike start(), join(), and sleep(), which belong to Thread class, these methods are in Object class because they can be called on any Java object, not just threads.📝 Example: Just like messages can be delivered by a postman, teacher, or student, inter-thread communication methods can be used on any object! 📩🎓🖊 4. Method Declarations:✅ wait() Methods:👉🏻public final void wait() throws InterruptedException 👉🏻public final native void wait(long ms) throws InterruptedException 👉🏻public final void wait(long ms, int ns) throws InterruptedException✅ notify() Method:👉🏻public final native void notify()✅ notifyAll() Method:👉🏻public final native void notifyAll()hashtag#Java hashtag#Multithreading hashtag#Learning hashtag#Coding hashtag#InterThreadCommunication  hashtag#Durgasoft hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment
