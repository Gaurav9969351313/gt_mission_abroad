Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it.

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?

Hardik BhawsarHardik Bhawsar,,"🚀 Day 5/30 – ""Garbage In, Garbage Out: Why AI Needs Good Data"" 🗑️Have you ever heard the phrase “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO)? Well, it’s not just a saying—it’s a fundamental truth in AI.Imagine training an AI model with messy, biased, or incomplete data. What happens? It produces equally messy, biased, and unreliable results. 😬🔹 What is GIGO in AI?GIGO means that the quality of an AI model’s output is only as good as the quality of the data it was trained on. If an AI learns from flawed, biased, or outdated data, it will generate responses that reflect those flaws.🔹 Real-world examples of GIGO- Biased AI Hiring Tools – If a model is trained on biased hiring data, it may unintentionally discriminate against certain candidates.- Misinformation in Chatbots – If AI is trained on incorrect facts, it will confidently spread misinformation.- Bad AI-Generated Art – If an AI art model is fed low-quality images, its creations will look distorted or unrealistic.🔹 How to Fix GIGO in AI?- Clean & Curate Data – Ensure training data is diverse, accurate, and up-to-date.- Reduce Bias – Actively check for and remove biases in datasets.- Human Oversight – AI should assist, not replace, critical human decision-making.AI is only as smart as the data we give it. Better data = better AI performance. hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AITraining hashtag#LLMs hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#DataScience hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#30DayAIChallenge hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#Software hashtag#Engineer hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper

Somesh ShanbhagSomesh Shanbhag,,"Why Every Business Analyst Should Teach a Sport at Least OnceMost people don’t see the connection between teaching swimming and business analytics, but they should.At Shelly Swimming School, I teach students how to swim by breaking down every movement into easy, repeatable steps. I don’t just tell them what to do, I show, discuss, and guide them iteratively until it becomes second nature. I catch even the smallest mistakes, explain how they impact efficiency, and let them feel the difference between bad technique and good technique. More importantly, I make sure they enjoy the process.What does this have to do with business analytics? Everything.In data and analytics, success isn’t just about having technical skills, it’s about:✅ Breaking complexity into simple, actionable steps (Think about how we build dashboards, models, and reports for stakeholders who may not be technical.)✅ Iterating and improving based on real feedback (We don’t just create an analysis and walk away—we refine it until it drives value.)✅ Explaining ‘why’ mistakes matter (A misinterpreted KPI or a poor data visualization can mislead decision-makers just like a bad swimming habit can slow an athlete down.)✅ Keeping engagement high (Stakeholders won’t use insights if they don’t see the value—just like students won’t improve if they see swimming as a chore.)So that's why I'm interested to hear from you:What’s a unique skill you’ve learned outside of work that made you better at your corporate job?
