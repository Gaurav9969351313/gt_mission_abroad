No more interviews.Just tarot cards, star signs, and the occasional lucky bamboo.Here’s how it works: 🔮 Horoscope-based Skill Matching – Aries? Great, you’re assertive — perfect for DevOps. Pisces? A UX designer with empathetic energy. 🍵 Tea Leaf Reading for Career Paths – HR professionals now interpret tea residue to recommend your next career move. One leaf curl = sales. Three spirals = cybersecurity. 🃏 Tarot Resume Reviews – Recruiters pull three cards to assess your potential. If the Tower appears, switching jobs may not be a good time. 🌕 Full Moon Offer Letters – All job offers are sent exclusively during full moons for ""maximum alignment.""The rollout is already in full swing. One tech company claims a 37% drop in onboarding time since switching from ATS software to a local monk with a pendulum.Nexmove, however, is taking a slightly more realistic approach.We believe in data, market insights, and authentic human connections (no Ouija boards involved) to match Thailand’s top talent with the best tech and digital employers.👁️‍🗨️ Want to find your next great hire — or your next great job — without needing to consult your spirit animal?We’ve got you.🌟 Forget fate.

The game is changing FAST.🔥 What’s happening in the tech world?✅ AI & Automation → Not here to ""steal"" your job, but to ""change"" it. Engineers who adapt will thrive. Those who don’t? Well… they might be writing LinkedIn posts about layoffs. 💀✅ Full-Stack & AI Skills Are GOLD → Companies now want problem solvers, not just coders. If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

Talentology AUTalentology AU,,"“Trevor, is it just me or is the IT project management market really struggling at the moment? It seems more and more PMs are looking for work? What can I do to stand out?”You’re not imagining it.The IT PM market in Australia is tight right now and many experienced PMs are feeling it:👉 Out of work for months👉 Ghosted by recruiters👉 Watching job ads vanish before they hit ‘Apply’So… what’s really going on?1. Infra work has dried upCloud, SaaS and Infrastructure-as-Code have reduced demand for traditional Infra PMs.2. Offshoring is squeezing local PMsOver 20,000 tech roles were offshored in 2024 - especially in banking and telco.3. AI is chainsawing the adminTools like Copilot and ClickUp AI now generate reports, task plans, meeting summaries - even risk logs.4. Hiring cycles are slower, competition’s tougherIt now takes 10 weeks longer (on average) to land a role than it did pre-COVID5. The jobs that do exist call for unicornsEspecially in banking and insurance. Good luck - the unicorn farm is closed to the public!So what do you need to do to stand out?Play a different game. The old one’s broken.- Stop applying with the same resume and hoping something changes.- Show impact, not activity like “Cut delivery time by 30% across 5 squads.” or “Saved $2M via DevOps uplift.”- Use GenAI to sharpen your edgeUse ChatGPT or GenAI to: • Compare resume to JD • Identify strengths and gaps • Build mini case studies to show employers and recruiter how you’ll adaptThen hustle your way into a convo - or apply with a knock-out cover letter and tailored resume.You don’t have to be a unicorn. You just need to connect the dots for the person reading your application.Also, how about reinventing yourself to get ahead of the curve rather than falling off it?✅ Show you’re AI-augmented“Used Fireflies and Copilot to automate reporting and action tracking.”✅ Double down on what AI can’t replace - people and change leadershipStrong communication, stakeholder wrangling and calm under pressure? That’s your edge.✅ Target sectors still growingCloud, cyber, ESG, AI governance, compliance, government digital - these are still hiring.✅ Get active and visibleYour LinkedIn isn’t a CV - it’s your positioning statement, your personal billboard.

Trevor ChurchleyTrevor Churchley,,"“Trevor, is it just me or is the IT project management market really struggling at the moment? It seems more and more PMs are looking for work? What can I do to stand out?”You’re not imagining it.The IT PM market in Australia is tight right now and many experienced PMs are feeling it:👉 Out of work for months👉 Ghosted by recruiters👉 Watching job ads vanish before they hit ‘Apply’So… what’s really going on?1. Infra work has dried upCloud, SaaS and Infrastructure-as-Code have reduced demand for traditional Infra PMs.2. Offshoring is squeezing local PMsOver 20,000 tech roles were offshored in 2024 - especially in banking and telco.3. AI is chainsawing the adminTools like Copilot and ClickUp AI now generate reports, task plans, meeting summaries - even risk logs.4. Hiring cycles are slower, competition’s tougherIt now takes 10 weeks longer (on average) to land a role than it did pre-COVID5. The jobs that do exist call for unicornsEspecially in banking and insurance. Good luck - the unicorn farm is closed to the public!So what do you need to do to stand out?Play a different game. The old one’s broken.- Stop applying with the same resume and hoping something changes.- Show impact, not activity like “Cut delivery time by 30% across 5 squads.” or “Saved $2M via DevOps uplift.”- Use GenAI to sharpen your edgeUse ChatGPT or GenAI to: •	Compare resume to JD •	Identify strengths and gaps •	Build mini case studies to show employers and recruiter how you’ll adaptThen hustle your way into a convo - or apply with a knock-out cover letter and tailored resume.You don’t have to be a unicorn. You just need to connect the dots for the person reading your application.Also, how about reinventing yourself to get ahead of the curve rather than falling off it?✅ Show you’re AI-augmented“Used Fireflies and Copilot to automate reporting and action tracking.”✅ Double down on what AI can’t replace - people and change leadershipStrong communication, stakeholder wrangling and calm under pressure? That’s your edge.✅ Target sectors still growingCloud, cyber, ESG, AI governance, compliance, government digital - these are still hiring.✅ Get active and visibleYour LinkedIn isn’t a CV - it’s your positioning statement, your personal billboard. Show up. Share insights. Be relevant. Tell the world who you are!The market is tough - but not hopeless.There’s still strong demand for PMs who are:✅ Tech-savvy✅ Value-driven✅ Adaptable✅ People-powered✅ AI-readyIf you’re a PM feeling stuck, I get it.My advice? Reposition, rebrand and reconnect.Give it a go.

If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

No more interviews.Just tarot cards, star signs, and the occasional lucky bamboo.Here’s how it works: 🔮 Horoscope-based Skill Matching – Aries? Great, you’re assertive — perfect for DevOps. Pisces? A UX designer with empathetic energy. 🍵 Tea Leaf Reading for Career Paths – HR professionals now interpret tea residue to recommend your next career move. One leaf curl = sales. Three spirals = cybersecurity. 🃏 Tarot Resume Reviews – Recruiters pull three cards to assess your potential. If the Tower appears, switching jobs may not be a good time. 🌕 Full Moon Offer Letters – All job offers are sent exclusively during full moons for ""maximum alignment.""The rollout is already in full swing. One tech company claims a 37% drop in onboarding time since switching from ATS software to a local monk with a pendulum.Nexmove, however, is taking a slightly more realistic approach.We believe in data, market insights, and authentic human connections (no Ouija boards involved) to match Thailand’s top talent with the best tech and digital employers.👁️‍🗨️ Want to find your next great hire — or your next great job — without needing to consult your spirit animal?We’ve got you.🌟 Forget fate.

Suyash Gupta 💡Suyash Gupta 💡,,"Day 1 🚀 The Future of Software Engineering in India – What’s Next? 🤖Remember when everyone thought engineering = government job or TCS/Infosys? 🤡Well, 2025 is NOT that era anymore. The game is changing FAST.🔥 What’s happening in the tech world?✅ AI & Automation → Not here to ""steal"" your job, but to ""change"" it. Engineers who adapt will thrive. Those who don’t? Well… they might be writing LinkedIn posts about layoffs. 💀✅ Full-Stack & AI Skills Are GOLD → Companies now want problem solvers, not just coders. If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

Suyash Gupta 💡Suyash Gupta 💡,,"Day 1 🚀 The Future of Software Engineering in India – What’s Next? 🤖Remember when everyone thought engineering = government job or TCS/Infosys? 🤡Well, 2025 is NOT that era anymore. The game is changing FAST.🔥 What’s happening in the tech world?✅ AI & Automation → Not here to ""steal"" your job, but to ""change"" it. Engineers who adapt will thrive. Those who don’t? Well… they might be writing LinkedIn posts about layoffs. 💀✅ Full-Stack & AI Skills Are GOLD → Companies now want problem solvers, not just coders. If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE

A UX designer with empathetic energy. 🍵 Tea Leaf Reading for Career Paths – HR professionals now interpret tea residue to recommend your next career move. One leaf curl = sales. Three spirals = cybersecurity. 🃏 Tarot Resume Reviews – Recruiters pull three cards to assess your potential. If the Tower appears, switching jobs may not be a good time. 🌕 Full Moon Offer Letters – All job offers are sent exclusively during full moons for ""maximum alignment.""The rollout is already in full swing. One tech company claims a 37% drop in onboarding time since switching from ATS software to a local monk with a pendulum.Nexmove, however, is taking a slightly more realistic approach.We believe in data, market insights, and authentic human connections (no Ouija boards involved) to match Thailand’s top talent with the best tech and digital employers.👁️‍🗨️ Want to find your next great hire — or your next great job — without needing to consult your spirit animal?We’ve got you.🌟 Forget fate. Let’s talk strategy. 🔗 hashtag#AprilFools hashtag#ThailandJobs hashtag#FortuneTellingRecruitment hashtag#Nexmove hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#DataDrivenRecruitment

I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship.

If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE

Suyash Gupta 💡Suyash Gupta 💡,,"Day 1 🚀 The Future of Software Engineering in India – What’s Next? 🤖Remember when everyone thought engineering = government job or TCS/Infosys? 🤡Well, 2025 is NOT that era anymore. The game is changing FAST.🔥 What’s happening in the tech world?✅ AI & Automation → Not here to ""steal"" your job, but to ""change"" it. Engineers who adapt will thrive. Those who don’t? Well… they might be writing LinkedIn posts about layoffs. 💀✅ Full-Stack & AI Skills Are GOLD → Companies now want problem solvers, not just coders. If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE

No more interviews.Just tarot cards, star signs, and the occasional lucky bamboo.Here’s how it works: 🔮 Horoscope-based Skill Matching – Aries? Great, you’re assertive — perfect for DevOps. Pisces? A UX designer with empathetic energy. 🍵 Tea Leaf Reading for Career Paths – HR professionals now interpret tea residue to recommend your next career move. One leaf curl = sales. Three spirals = cybersecurity. 🃏 Tarot Resume Reviews – Recruiters pull three cards to assess your potential. If the Tower appears, switching jobs may not be a good time. 🌕 Full Moon Offer Letters – All job offers are sent exclusively during full moons for ""maximum alignment.""The rollout is already in full swing.

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE

I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship.

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE

The game is changing FAST.🔥 What’s happening in the tech world?✅ AI & Automation → Not here to ""steal"" your job, but to ""change"" it. Engineers who adapt will thrive. Those who don’t? Well… they might be writing LinkedIn posts about layoffs. 💀✅ Full-Stack & AI Skills Are GOLD → Companies now want problem solvers, not just coders. If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship.

The game is changing FAST.🔥 What’s happening in the tech world?✅ AI & Automation → Not here to ""steal"" your job, but to ""change"" it. Engineers who adapt will thrive. Those who don’t? Well… they might be writing LinkedIn posts about layoffs. 💀✅ Full-Stack & AI Skills Are GOLD → Companies now want problem solvers, not just coders. If you can build end-to-end applications + AI-powered features, you're unstoppable in the market.✅ Remote Work is Normal → You no longer need to move to Bangalore, Pune, or Hyderabad. Companies are hiring remotely, global opportunities are opening up 🌍.✅ Startups are BOOMING → MNCs are cool, but startups pay big 💰 if you have the right skills. Want equity, flexible work, and fast growth? Startups are waiting.---💡 What Should You Do in 2025?🔹 Learn AI + Cloud + DevOps basics → These aren’t just buzzwords; they’re what companies pay the highest salaries for.🔹 Improve Soft Skills → You can write the best code, but if you can’t explain it, someone else will get promoted over you. Learn to communicate!🔹 Contribute to Open Source & Build Real Projects → Your GitHub & LinkedIn are the new resumes. No one cares about a 2-page CV anymore.🔹 Think Beyond Just Jobs → The freelance & startup ecosystem is booming. Many techies are making 10x salaries by building products & consulting.---🎯 Final Thought:Software engineering in India is not dying, not saturated, and not boring.It’s evolving, and the ones who adapt & upskill will be the real winners.👀 What’s YOUR take?Where do you see the future of software engineering in India?

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE
