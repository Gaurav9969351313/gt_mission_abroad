I'm looking for those types of roles:  ✅ Learning and Development Manager  ✅ Organizational Development Manager ✅ Performance Improvement consultant ✅ Instruction Designer and Learning Experience Designer ✅ People Manager✅ Marketing Specialist ✅ User Experience DesignerIf you're hiring or know someone who needs an innovative, growth-mindset-minded talent development and design leader who focuses of solutions that have a direct impact on business results, contact me and pass the word on.hashtag#OpenToWork
