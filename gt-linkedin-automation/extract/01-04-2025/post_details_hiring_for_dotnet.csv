I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together. Because… lol. We’re all figuring it out.(And yes, mutual aid welcome—sharing, tagging, hiring, referring, or just checking in all count as support.)

This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together. Because… lol. We’re all figuring it out.(And yes, mutual aid welcome—sharing, tagging, hiring, referring, or just checking in all count as support.)

It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

Help meeeee.For real though—I’m in another transitional season and trying to be loud and honest about it. I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together. Because… lol. We’re all figuring it out.(And yes, mutual aid welcome—sharing, tagging, hiring, referring, or just checking in all count as support.)

Help meeeee.For real though—I’m in another transitional season and trying to be loud and honest about it. I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together. Because… lol. We’re all figuring it out.(And yes, mutual aid welcome—sharing, tagging, hiring, referring, or just checking in all count as support.)

Jennifer PhillipsJennifer Phillips,,"I hate that I present as an independent woman who doesn’t need help. It’s a facade. Help meeeee.For real though—I’m in another transitional season and trying to be loud and honest about it. I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together. Because… lol. We’re all figuring it out.(And yes, mutual aid welcome—sharing, tagging, hiring, referring, or just checking in all count as support.)

SciatiX SolutionsSciatiX Solutions,sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf,"🚨 Internship Update: Originally, we needed just 20 interns. Then 2,000 applications flooded in, so we expanded to 120 seats by partnering with our networks. Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors. Our souls have left our bodies. The caffeine gods have abandoned us.But don’t worry—we’re still trying to process applications… if our hearts don’t explode first. Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers.. And yeah we actually see your Github History in detail.Anyone who thinks we underestimated them, can requestion us anytime on This Page or on mail sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf by chance , our whole nasheri team did wrong evaluation together, then you will be the only member in company (on requestioning).Please do not say to reconsider you on increasing seats. seats increased just becz deserving candidates increased (real world , real impact developers).If anyone want any consultation, how to land into first internhsip or brutal honest review of the cv, We are always here. (for those who got rejection from us).Hope u like this Katha.Atleast gaali wgera he de do comment me 🫠...

This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

SciatiX SolutionsSciatiX Solutions,sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf,"🚨 Internship Update: Originally, we needed just 20 interns. Then 2,000 applications flooded in, so we expanded to 120 seats by partnering with our networks. Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors. Our souls have left our bodies. The caffeine gods have abandoned us.But don’t worry—we’re still trying to process applications… if our hearts don’t explode first. Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers.. And yeah we actually see your Github History in detail.Anyone who thinks we underestimated them, can requestion us anytime on This Page or on mail sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf by chance , our whole nasheri team did wrong evaluation together, then you will be the only member in company (on requestioning).Please do not say to reconsider you on increasing seats. seats increased just becz deserving candidates increased (real world , real impact developers).If anyone want any consultation, how to land into first internhsip or brutal honest review of the cv, We are always here.

I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors.

Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers..

I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors.

Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers..

It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

Then 2,000 applications flooded in, so we expanded to 120 seats by partnering with our networks. Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors. Our souls have left our bodies. The caffeine gods have abandoned us.But don’t worry—we’re still trying to process applications… if our hearts don’t explode first. Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers.. And yeah we actually see your Github History in detail.Anyone who thinks we underestimated them, can requestion us anytime on This Page or on mail sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf by chance , our whole nasheri team did wrong evaluation together, then you will be the only member in company (on requestioning).Please do not say to reconsider you on increasing seats. seats increased just becz deserving candidates increased (real world , real impact developers).If anyone want any consultation, how to land into first internhsip or brutal honest review of the cv, We are always here.

It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

Miguel AugustínMiguel Augustín,,"Can't recommend Michael enough,  serious design skills and a great person to work with!"
SciatiX SolutionsSciatiX Solutions,sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf,"🚨 Internship Update: Originally, we needed just 20 interns. Then 2,000 applications flooded in, so we expanded to 120 seats by partnering with our networks. Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors. Our souls have left our bodies. The caffeine gods have abandoned us.But don’t worry—we’re still trying to process applications… if our hearts don’t explode first. Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers.. And yeah we actually see your Github History in detail.Anyone who thinks we underestimated them, can requestion us anytime on This Page or on mail sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf by chance , our whole nasheri team did wrong evaluation together, then you will be the only member in company (on requestioning).Please do not say to reconsider you on increasing seats. seats increased just becz deserving candidates increased (real world , real impact developers).If anyone want any consultation, how to land into first internhsip or brutal honest review of the cv, We are always here. (for those who got rejection from us).Hope u like this Katha.Atleast gaali wgera he de do comment me 🫠...

I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

Then 2,000 applications flooded in, so we expanded to 120 seats by partnering with our networks. Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors. Our souls have left our bodies. The caffeine gods have abandoned us.But don’t worry—we’re still trying to process applications… if our hearts don’t explode first. Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers.. And yeah we actually see your Github History in detail.Anyone who thinks we underestimated them, can requestion us anytime on This Page or on mail sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf by chance , our whole nasheri team did wrong evaluation together, then you will be the only member in company (on requestioning).Please do not say to reconsider you on increasing seats. seats increased just becz deserving candidates increased (real world , real impact developers).If anyone want any consultation, how to land into first internhsip or brutal honest review of the cv, We are always here.

Anivi ReddyAnivi Reddy,,"""Job Searching Feels Like Debugging—But I’m Closer to the Solution."" 🛠️A few months ago, I started my job search. At first, I thought, “With my skills and experience, this should be smooth.” But just like debugging a tough production issue, things didn’t go as planned.❌ Some applications went unanswered.❌ A few interviews didn’t turn into offers.❌ And imposter syndrome? Yeah, that crept in too.But here’s what I realized—every rejection is just a test case that failed before finding the right fix. And just like in coding, iteration is key.✅ I refined my approach.✅ I learned to highlight impact over experience in interviews.✅ I connected with amazing people who shared their insights.Now, I’m actively looking for a Full Stack Developer role where I can:💡 Solve complex problems with .NET, React, and cloud technologies.⚡ Build scalable, high-performance applications.🚀 Work with a team that values innovation and growth.If you know of any opportunities (or just have job search wisdom to share), let’s connect!To those also in the job hunt—what’s one lesson you’ve learned in this process? Drop it in the comments!👇hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#DotNet hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#HiringWhy This Works:✅ Relatable story (everyone has faced job search struggles)✅ Strong analogy (debugging = job search challenges)✅ Calls for engagement (asking for advice & connections)✅ Positions you as proactive & growth-orientedWould you like me to adjust the tone or focus on a specific aspect? 😊

This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

Then 2,000 applications flooded in, so we expanded to 120 seats by partnering with our networks. Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you.

We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers.. And yeah we actually see your Github History in detail.Anyone who thinks we underestimated them, can requestion us anytime on This Page or on mail sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf by chance , our whole nasheri team did wrong evaluation together, then you will be the only member in company (on requestioning).Please do not say to reconsider you on increasing seats. seats increased just becz deserving candidates increased (real world , real impact developers).If anyone want any consultation, how to land into first internhsip or brutal honest review of the cv, We are always here. (for those who got rejection from us).Hope u like this Katha.Atleast gaali wgera he de do comment me 🫠...

Help meeeee.For real though—I’m in another transitional season and trying to be loud and honest about it. I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together. Because… lol. We’re all figuring it out.(And yes, mutual aid welcome—sharing, tagging, hiring, referring, or just checking in all count as support.)

Then 2,000 applications flooded in, so we expanded to 120 seats by partnering with our networks. Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors. Our souls have left our bodies. The caffeine gods have abandoned us.But don’t worry—we’re still trying to process applications… if our hearts don’t explode first. Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers.. And yeah we actually see your Github History in detail.Anyone who thinks we underestimated them, can requestion us anytime on This Page or on mail sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf by chance , our whole nasheri team did wrong evaluation together, then you will be the only member in company (on requestioning).Please do not say to reconsider you on increasing seats. seats increased just becz deserving candidates increased (real world , real impact developers).If anyone want any consultation, how to land into first internhsip or brutal honest review of the cv, We are always here.

Anivi ReddyAnivi Reddy,,"""Job Searching Feels Like Debugging—But I’m Closer to the Solution."" 🛠️A few months ago, I started my job search. At first, I thought, “With my skills and experience, this should be smooth.” But just like debugging a tough production issue, things didn’t go as planned.❌ Some applications went unanswered.❌ A few interviews didn’t turn into offers.❌ And imposter syndrome? Yeah, that crept in too.But here’s what I realized—every rejection is just a test case that failed before finding the right fix. And just like in coding, iteration is key.✅ I refined my approach.✅ I learned to highlight impact over experience in interviews.✅ I connected with amazing people who shared their insights.Now, I’m actively looking for a Full Stack Developer role where I can:💡 Solve complex problems with .NET, React, and cloud technologies.⚡ Build scalable, high-performance applications.🚀 Work with a team that values innovation and growth.If you know of any opportunities (or just have job search wisdom to share), let’s connect!To those also in the job hunt—what’s one lesson you’ve learned in this process? Drop it in the comments!👇hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#DotNet hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#HiringWhy This Works:✅ Relatable story (everyone has faced job search struggles)✅ Strong analogy (debugging = job search challenges)✅ Calls for engagement (asking for advice & connections)✅ Positions you as proactive & growth-orientedWould you like me to adjust the tone or focus on a specific aspect? 😊

I’m figuring out what’s next, professionally and creatively, and while I’m resourceful as hell… I’m also tired of doing it all alone. It’s April, and I now have time for NEW things!So here’s where I’m at (right now):— I’m looking for contract or project-based work that gives me space to keep building out my own thing(s).— My sweet spot is org development, strategic execution, leadership/culture work, and making teams run smoother and more human.— I also offer connection coaching (for individuals and couples)—think clarity, communication, and building healthier relationships with self and others. This spans from professional development to relational development… It’s all connected. And I’m reworking my offerings—thinking tools, workshops, and possibly a course or two. I’ll be getting louder and clearer soon, but I’d love to hear from you:What would you actually want to see from me? What would you pay for? What would help you, your team, or your org right now?So yes—help me:— Find aligned paid work (consulting contracts, project roles, special projects, fractional Chief of Staff / Director of Special Projects roles, coaching clients)— Share this post if it might land with someone in your orbit— Just reach out and say hey if you’ve been meaning toThanks in advance for seeing me, for sharing, for helping, for not believing the hype that I’ve got it all together.

Then 2,000 applications flooded in, so we expanded to 120 seats by partnering with our networks. Now? 5,000+ applications later, we had no choice but to scale up to 230 seats—because clearly, we enjoy suffering. 🫠🎉 More companies, more opportunities, more chances for us to regret our life choices!BUT LISTEN UP! We personally begged—uhh, negotiated—your incentives (same as we promised), guaranteed your performance, and basically put our reputation on the line for you. So if you don’t work hard, we’ll be forced to fake our own deaths and move to the Himalayas. They are like us- just with 10x the toxicity because these companies are somehow even more toxic than us. Buckle up. 💀Now, about the delay in responses and selection—our team is literally non-functional right now. Each member has consumed 50+ cans of Red Bull in the last 3 days. We can hear colors. Our souls have left our bodies. The caffeine gods have abandoned us.But don’t worry—we’re still trying to process applications… if our hearts don’t explode first. Stay tuned. 😵☕🚑The reply may take a week , Sorry for that... We are regretting the start of this NO ATS, NO Automated Email & No ghosting decision....As applicants not actually value the efforts that we are seeing even the links , so that noone gets judged by not knowning to make a good CV, becz we want coders and not Resume writers.. And yeah we actually see your Github History in detail.Anyone who thinks we underestimated them, can requestion us anytime on This Page or on mail sciatix.solutions@gmail.comIf by chance , our whole nasheri team did wrong evaluation together, then you will be the only member in company (on requestioning).Please do not say to reconsider you on increasing seats. seats increased just becz deserving candidates increased (real world , real impact developers).If anyone want any consultation, how to land into first internhsip or brutal honest review of the cv, We are always here.

Anivi ReddyAnivi Reddy,,"""Job Searching Feels Like Debugging—But I’m Closer to the Solution."" 🛠️A few months ago, I started my job search. At first, I thought, “With my skills and experience, this should be smooth.” But just like debugging a tough production issue, things didn’t go as planned.❌ Some applications went unanswered.❌ A few interviews didn’t turn into offers.❌ And imposter syndrome? Yeah, that crept in too.But here’s what I realized—every rejection is just a test case that failed before finding the right fix. And just like in coding, iteration is key.✅ I refined my approach.✅ I learned to highlight impact over experience in interviews.✅ I connected with amazing people who shared their insights.Now, I’m actively looking for a Full Stack Developer role where I can:💡 Solve complex problems with .NET, React, and cloud technologies.⚡ Build scalable, high-performance applications.🚀 Work with a team that values innovation and growth.If you know of any opportunities (or just have job search wisdom to share), let’s connect!To those also in the job hunt—what’s one lesson you’ve learned in this process? Drop it in the comments!👇hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#DotNet hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#HiringWhy This Works:✅ Relatable story (everyone has faced job search struggles)✅ Strong analogy (debugging = job search challenges)✅ Calls for engagement (asking for advice & connections)✅ Positions you as proactive & growth-orientedWould you like me to adjust the tone or focus on a specific aspect? 😊
