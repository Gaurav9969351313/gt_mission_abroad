Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Want to understand how G1GC works and why it replaced CMS GC?The G1 (Garbage First) Garbage Collector was introduced as an evolution of CMS, designed to deliver low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory fragmentation. Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

When it's our first placement, it's worth celebrating, especially when we’re shaking things up in recruitment.Our client, a Sales Manager, struggled to fill a role, even after using multiple traditional agencies with plenty of interviews, but never hitting the mark. Then alignr stepped in.💡 The fix: We improved & simplified the hiring process, cut out the guesswork, and placed the right Sales Administrator in under 3 weeks.But speed wasn’t the only win; here’s what made the difference:🔹 Strategic Role Brief: We went beyond a job description, mapping out team dynamics, key attitudes, not just skills, to understand what’s going to engage the market!🔹 Shortlist in 3 Days: Transparent, easy-to-review profiles on live platform (no email chaos). Delivered with detailed candidate insights to drive better interviews.🔹 Better Interviews: Hiring managers received interview Scorecards & Structured tactics. Ensured consistency, confident hiring managers, and engaged candidates.🔹 High-Touch Candidate Experience: Frequent updates = better engagement & a stronger employer brand. The level of engagement we got was amazing, thank you, everyone!When hiring is aligned with what truly matters, results follow.Hiring delays slow down sales.

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Alex KingAlex King,,"A little belated, but never too late! When it's our first placement, it's worth celebrating, especially when we’re shaking things up in recruitment.Our client, a Sales Manager, struggled to fill a role, even after using multiple traditional agencies with plenty of interviews, but never hitting the mark. Then alignr stepped in.💡 The fix: We improved & simplified the hiring process, cut out the guesswork, and placed the right Sales Administrator in under 3 weeks.But speed wasn’t the only win; here’s what made the difference:🔹 Strategic Role Brief: We went beyond a job description, mapping out team dynamics, key attitudes, not just skills, to understand what’s going to engage the market!🔹 Shortlist in 3 Days: Transparent, easy-to-review profiles on live platform (no email chaos). Delivered with detailed candidate insights to drive better interviews.🔹 Better Interviews: Hiring managers received interview Scorecards & Structured tactics. Ensured consistency, confident hiring managers, and engaged candidates.🔹 High-Touch Candidate Experience: Frequent updates = better engagement & a stronger employer brand. The level of engagement we got was amazing, thank you, everyone!When hiring is aligned with what truly matters, results follow.Hiring delays slow down sales.

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Then alignr stepped in.💡 The fix: We improved & simplified the hiring process, cut out the guesswork, and placed the right Sales Administrator in under 3 weeks.But speed wasn’t the only win; here’s what made the difference:🔹 Strategic Role Brief: We went beyond a job description, mapping out team dynamics, key attitudes, not just skills, to understand what’s going to engage the market!🔹 Shortlist in 3 Days: Transparent, easy-to-review profiles on live platform (no email chaos). Delivered with detailed candidate insights to drive better interviews.🔹 Better Interviews: Hiring managers received interview Scorecards & Structured tactics. Ensured consistency, confident hiring managers, and engaged candidates.🔹 High-Touch Candidate Experience: Frequent updates = better engagement & a stronger employer brand.

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Then alignr stepped in.💡 The fix: We improved & simplified the hiring process, cut out the guesswork, and placed the right Sales Administrator in under 3 weeks.But speed wasn’t the only win; here’s what made the difference:🔹 Strategic Role Brief: We went beyond a job description, mapping out team dynamics, key attitudes, not just skills, to understand what’s going to engage the market!🔹 Shortlist in 3 Days: Transparent, easy-to-review profiles on live platform (no email chaos). Delivered with detailed candidate insights to drive better interviews.🔹 Better Interviews: Hiring managers received interview Scorecards & Structured tactics. Ensured consistency, confident hiring managers, and engaged candidates.🔹 High-Touch Candidate Experience: Frequent updates = better engagement & a stronger employer brand.

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Then alignr stepped in.💡 The fix: We improved & simplified the hiring process, cut out the guesswork, and placed the right Sales Administrator in under 3 weeks.But speed wasn’t the only win; here’s what made the difference:🔹 Strategic Role Brief: We went beyond a job description, mapping out team dynamics, key attitudes, not just skills, to understand what’s going to engage the market!🔹 Shortlist in 3 Days: Transparent, easy-to-review profiles on live platform (no email chaos). Delivered with detailed candidate insights to drive better interviews.🔹 Better Interviews: Hiring managers received interview Scorecards & Structured tactics.

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE

Unlike traditional collectors, G1GC divides the heap into dynamic regions instead of fixed generations, allowing better allocation and collection efficiency.When should you consider using it? - Applications that require predictable garbage collection pauses. - Systems with large heaps that need efficient memory management. - Workloads where latency and performance balance is critical.The downside? - Requires fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance. - More complex configuration compared to default collectors.Fun fact: - G1GC became the default GC in Java 9, replacing CMS and offering automatic memory compaction to avoid fragmentation issues.Want to try it?  - Add this JVM option: -XX:+UseG1GCWant to dive deeper into Java Garbage Collectors?

Nina KotovaNina Kotova,,"Not all recruiters are the problem.In my previous post, I talked about shady recruiters and companies—especially recruiters. And yes, I often criticize the hiring process.I often write about how hard it is to find a job. How the hiring process can be far from logical. How job searching feels like a long, exhausting marathon.But there's one important thing I want to highlight: I have met some truly great recruiters✨️.They don’t just conduct interviews and send the usual “we went with another candidate” message. They help you understand the market, share valuable insights, and genuinely want candidates to find the right fit.Unfortunately, even the best recruiters can’t create opportunities where none exist. But that doesn’t mean their work is meaningless. I’ve met professionals who are truly passionate about what they do, making the job search feel a little less lonely.🔥I appreciate their work and sincerely hope they continue to succeed—with great candidates, fewer hiring challenges, and maybe even a little less criticism (for example, from me).Recruiters, thank you for everything you do!Have you come across great recruiters in your job search?hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#recruiting hashtag#career hashtag#hiring hashtag#hr

Then alignr stepped in.💡 The fix: We improved & simplified the hiring process, cut out the guesswork, and placed the right Sales Administrator in under 3 weeks.But speed wasn’t the only win; here’s what made the difference:🔹 Strategic Role Brief: We went beyond a job description, mapping out team dynamics, key attitudes, not just skills, to understand what’s going to engage the market!🔹 Shortlist in 3 Days: Transparent, easy-to-review profiles on live platform (no email chaos). Delivered with detailed candidate insights to drive better interviews.🔹 Better Interviews: Hiring managers received interview Scorecards & Structured tactics. Ensured consistency, confident hiring managers, and engaged candidates.🔹 High-Touch Candidate Experience: Frequent updates = better engagement & a stronger employer brand.

Jay JoshiJay Joshi,,"🚀 Seeking Summer 2025 Internship in Data Science / Machine Learning / Software Engineering (U.S.) 🚀Hi LinkedIn! I'm Jay Joshi, a current MS Data Science student at San Jose State University, and I'm actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in the U.S. in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Software Engineering.Skills: My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, JavaScript, and modern AI/ML frameworks (LLMs like GPT & BERT, GANs, PyTorch, TensorFlow), as well as full-stack development tools (React, RESTful APIs, Django) and cloud/DevOps technologies (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes). I’m passionate about leveraging these skills to solve real-world problems.Project Highlights:Study Buddy – an AI tutoring app I built (at a UC Berkeley Hackathon) using Hume AI’s voice emotion inference and a fine-tuned Google Gemma 2 LLM (via LangChain + RAG). This project delivers personalized, context-aware tutoring and achieved ~90% accuracy in empathetic responses.Stock Price Prediction – Developed an LSTM-based model trained on 10 years of data for ~2,000 stocks, achieving ~97% prediction accuracy. I also built an interactive React.js dashboard with WebSocket for real-time updates and deployed the system in Docker on Google Cloud for scalability.Experience: I have hands-on development experience from internships at Launch Pad, Tatvasoft, and MatrixHive, where I worked on projects ranging from a book management platform to an e-commerce site to a cloud migration. These experiences honed my skills in full-stack development and scalable system design and taught me to collaborate in Agile team environments.I'm eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm to a Summer 2025 internship. If your team is hiring or if you know of any openings, I would greatly appreciate any referrals or connections. Please feel free to reach out or connect me with opportunities — I'd love to chat about how I can contribute!Thank you for your time and support.hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Internships hashtag#SummerInternship hashtag#SummerInternship2025 hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#Meta hashtag#SDE
