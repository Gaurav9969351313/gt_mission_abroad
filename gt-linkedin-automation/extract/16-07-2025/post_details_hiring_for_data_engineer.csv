Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Dion WigginsDion Wiggins,,"Manus AI didn’t move for chips.They moved because being Chinese-owned makes you globally unusable.Let’s stop pretending.✅ HQ relocated from Beijing to Singapore✅ China staff laid off or not relocated✅ Domestic operations shelved✅ Entire Chinese web presence scrubbed✅ Hiring international talent at USD salary levelsAnd yet the official line is:> “This move has nothing to do with U.S. chip restrictions—we don’t train large models.”That’s not a strategy. That’s damage control.Because the real risk isn’t about whether you need A100s.It’s about whether your jurisdiction gets you blacklisted.---If you’re an AI company based in China, you don’t get:→ Western enterprise clients→ Global infrastructure partnerships→ VC funding from the U.S. or EU→ Regulatory clearance for sensitive sectors→ Credibility in trust-sensitive marketsEvery conversation starts with:“How close are you to the CCP?”That’s the death sentence for global scale.---This move wasn’t about performance.It was about narrative and jurisdictional cleansing.This is the China-Origin Erasure Playbook in motion:→ Sever mainland operations→ Scrub digital footprint→ Reincorporate in a neutral zone→ Rebrand for Western acceptability→ Pretend it was always the planSingapore gives them:→ A neutral legal footprint→ Access to capital→ Distance from Chinese data laws→ Global hiring flexibility→ A non-toxic brandThis is the new AI playbook:De-risk your origin story or get left out of the global market.---Let’s not romanticize it.Manus is running the same rewrite many other firms will soon attempt.This isn’t a one-off.It’s a live signal to every AI founder:> The global AI market doesn’t care where your engineers are.It cares where your jurisdiction is.Expect more of this.Not just China.Any firm operating under a regime that triggers sanctions, surveillance suspicion, or compliance drag is already compromised.Watch closely. This is what geopolitical flight looks like in the AI era.

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes?

That’s damage control.Because the real risk isn’t about whether you need A100s.It’s about whether your jurisdiction gets you blacklisted.---If you’re an AI company based in China, you don’t get:→ Western enterprise clients→ Global infrastructure partnerships→ VC funding from the U.S. or EU→ Regulatory clearance for sensitive sectors→ Credibility in trust-sensitive marketsEvery conversation starts with:“How close are you to the CCP?”That’s the death sentence for global scale.---This move wasn’t about performance.It was about narrative and jurisdictional cleansing.This is the China-Origin Erasure Playbook in motion:→ Sever mainland operations→ Scrub digital footprint→ Reincorporate in a neutral zone→ Rebrand for Western acceptability→ Pretend it was always the planSingapore gives them:→ A neutral legal footprint→ Access to capital→ Distance from Chinese data laws→ Global hiring flexibility→ A non-toxic brandThis is the new AI playbook:De-risk your origin story or get left out of the global market.---Let’s not romanticize it.Manus is running the same rewrite many other firms will soon attempt.This isn’t a one-off.It’s a live signal to every AI founder:> The global AI market doesn’t care where your engineers are.It cares where your jurisdiction is.Expect more of this.Not just China.Any firm operating under a regime that triggers sanctions, surveillance suspicion, or compliance drag is already compromised.Watch closely.

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

That’s damage control.Because the real risk isn’t about whether you need A100s.It’s about whether your jurisdiction gets you blacklisted.---If you’re an AI company based in China, you don’t get:→ Western enterprise clients→ Global infrastructure partnerships→ VC funding from the U.S. or EU→ Regulatory clearance for sensitive sectors→ Credibility in trust-sensitive marketsEvery conversation starts with:“How close are you to the CCP?”That’s the death sentence for global scale.---This move wasn’t about performance.It was about narrative and jurisdictional cleansing.This is the China-Origin Erasure Playbook in motion:→ Sever mainland operations→ Scrub digital footprint→ Reincorporate in a neutral zone→ Rebrand for Western acceptability→ Pretend it was always the planSingapore gives them:→ A neutral legal footprint→ Access to capital→ Distance from Chinese data laws→ Global hiring flexibility→ A non-toxic brandThis is the new AI playbook:De-risk your origin story or get left out of the global market.---Let’s not romanticize it.Manus is running the same rewrite many other firms will soon attempt.This isn’t a one-off.It’s a live signal to every AI founder:> The global AI market doesn’t care where your engineers are.It cares where your jurisdiction is.Expect more of this.Not just China.Any firm operating under a regime that triggers sanctions, surveillance suspicion, or compliance drag is already compromised.Watch closely.

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Dion WigginsDion Wiggins,,"Manus AI didn’t move for chips.They moved because being Chinese-owned makes you globally unusable.Let’s stop pretending.✅ HQ relocated from Beijing to Singapore✅ China staff laid off or not relocated✅ Domestic operations shelved✅ Entire Chinese web presence scrubbed✅ Hiring international talent at USD salary levelsAnd yet the official line is:> “This move has nothing to do with U.S. chip restrictions—we don’t train large models.”That’s not a strategy. That’s damage control.Because the real risk isn’t about whether you need A100s.It’s about whether your jurisdiction gets you blacklisted.---If you’re an AI company based in China, you don’t get:→ Western enterprise clients→ Global infrastructure partnerships→ VC funding from the U.S. or EU→ Regulatory clearance for sensitive sectors→ Credibility in trust-sensitive marketsEvery conversation starts with:“How close are you to the CCP?”That’s the death sentence for global scale.---This move wasn’t about performance.It was about narrative and jurisdictional cleansing.This is the China-Origin Erasure Playbook in motion:→ Sever mainland operations→ Scrub digital footprint→ Reincorporate in a neutral zone→ Rebrand for Western acceptability→ Pretend it was always the planSingapore gives them:→ A neutral legal footprint→ Access to capital→ Distance from Chinese data laws→ Global hiring flexibility→ A non-toxic brandThis is the new AI playbook:De-risk your origin story or get left out of the global market.---Let’s not romanticize it.Manus is running the same rewrite many other firms will soon attempt.This isn’t a one-off.It’s a live signal to every AI founder:> The global AI market doesn’t care where your engineers are.It cares where your jurisdiction is.Expect more of this.Not just China.Any firm operating under a regime that triggers sanctions, surveillance suspicion, or compliance drag is already compromised.Watch closely.

Karthik KalyanaramanKarthik Kalyanaraman,,"You don’t need a growth team to turn signups into conversations — here’s how I did it in minutes. 👇 Most companies think turning waitlist signups into real conversations means hiring a data analyst or growth engineer to build complex automations. But what if you could skip all that? Recently, I tried something different: I signed up on the waitlist for our new product, and then used a bot we built called Zest — an AI agent running right inside Slack — to automatically pull info, write a personalized email, and draft it to my inbox. And it all happened in under two minutes without me leaving Slack.Traditionally, creating this kind of personalized waitlist engagement means spending 2–3 days setting up automation pipelines in tools like HubSpot or Marketo, plus additional time crafting email templates and testing workflows. What I showed took under two minutes — that’s roughly a 1,000% (or 10x) speed improvement. But it’s not just about speed.But it’s not just about speed. 1️⃣  It’s curated — tailored to each individual’s info. 2️⃣  It’s personal — making every interaction feel human, not automated. 3️⃣  And it’s collaborative — happening right inside Slack, so your team can see the prompts, join the conversation, and learn together.At the end of the day, AI should aid you—not replace you—and empower collaboration, making teams smarter and work more meaningful.Want to see how easy it is to deploy AI bots right inside Slack — in under two minutes? Join our waitlist! Link’s in the comments. 👇

Dion WigginsDion Wiggins,,"Manus AI didn’t move for chips.They moved because being Chinese-owned makes you globally unusable.Let’s stop pretending.✅ HQ relocated from Beijing to Singapore✅ China staff laid off or not relocated✅ Domestic operations shelved✅ Entire Chinese web presence scrubbed✅ Hiring international talent at USD salary levelsAnd yet the official line is:> “This move has nothing to do with U.S. chip restrictions—we don’t train large models.”That’s not a strategy. That’s damage control.Because the real risk isn’t about whether you need A100s.It’s about whether your jurisdiction gets you blacklisted.---If you’re an AI company based in China, you don’t get:→ Western enterprise clients→ Global infrastructure partnerships→ VC funding from the U.S. or EU→ Regulatory clearance for sensitive sectors→ Credibility in trust-sensitive marketsEvery conversation starts with:“How close are you to the CCP?”That’s the death sentence for global scale.---This move wasn’t about performance.It was about narrative and jurisdictional cleansing.This is the China-Origin Erasure Playbook in motion:→ Sever mainland operations→ Scrub digital footprint→ Reincorporate in a neutral zone→ Rebrand for Western acceptability→ Pretend it was always the planSingapore gives them:→ A neutral legal footprint→ Access to capital→ Distance from Chinese data laws→ Global hiring flexibility→ A non-toxic brandThis is the new AI playbook:De-risk your origin story or get left out of the global market.---Let’s not romanticize it.Manus is running the same rewrite many other firms will soon attempt.This isn’t a one-off.It’s a live signal to every AI founder:> The global AI market doesn’t care where your engineers are.It cares where your jurisdiction is.Expect more of this.Not just China.Any firm operating under a regime that triggers sanctions, surveillance suspicion, or compliance drag is already compromised.Watch closely. This is what geopolitical flight looks like in the AI era.
