Ilya MatsiushIlya Matsiush,,"🌟 From Rejected to Recruited: My Tech Interview Comeback StorySix months ago, I faced the toughest period of my career: 8 consecutive interview rejections. My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment? When the hiring manager said, ""Your methodical approach to your job search demonstrates exactly how you'd approach testing.""The rejection streak that felt like failure became the catalyst for the greatest growth in my career.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QACareers hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechInterviewsWhat's your biggest job search challenge right now?

My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment?

Ilya MatsiushIlya Matsiush,,"🌟 From Rejected to Recruited: My Tech Interview Comeback StorySix months ago, I faced the toughest period of my career: 8 consecutive interview rejections. My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment? When the hiring manager said, ""Your methodical approach to your job search demonstrates exactly how you'd approach testing.""The rejection streak that felt like failure became the catalyst for the greatest growth in my career.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QACareers hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechInterviewsWhat's your biggest job search challenge right now?

Ilya MatsiushIlya Matsiush,,"🌟 From Rejected to Recruited: My Tech Interview Comeback StorySix months ago, I faced the toughest period of my career: 8 consecutive interview rejections. My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment? When the hiring manager said, ""Your methodical approach to your job search demonstrates exactly how you'd approach testing.""The rejection streak that felt like failure became the catalyst for the greatest growth in my career.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QACareers hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechInterviewsWhat's your biggest job search challenge right now?

My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment?

Ilya MatsiushIlya Matsiush,,"🌟 From Rejected to Recruited: My Tech Interview Comeback StorySix months ago, I faced the toughest period of my career: 8 consecutive interview rejections. My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment? When the hiring manager said, ""Your methodical approach to your job search demonstrates exactly how you'd approach testing.""The rejection streak that felt like failure became the catalyst for the greatest growth in my career.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QACareers hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechInterviewsWhat's your biggest job search challenge right now?

My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment?

My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment?

Ilya MatsiushIlya Matsiush,,"🌟 From Rejected to Recruited: My Tech Interview Comeback StorySix months ago, I faced the toughest period of my career: 8 consecutive interview rejections. My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment? When the hiring manager said, ""Your methodical approach to your job search demonstrates exactly how you'd approach testing.""The rejection streak that felt like failure became the catalyst for the greatest growth in my career.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QACareers hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechInterviewsWhat's your biggest job search challenge right now?

Ilya MatsiushIlya Matsiush,,"🌟 From Rejected to Recruited: My Tech Interview Comeback StorySix months ago, I faced the toughest period of my career: 8 consecutive interview rejections. My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment? When the hiring manager said, ""Your methodical approach to your job search demonstrates exactly how you'd approach testing.""The rejection streak that felt like failure became the catalyst for the greatest growth in my career.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QACareers hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechInterviewsWhat's your biggest job search challenge right now?

My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment?

My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment?

I have seen this have an impact on recruitment processes, the number of applications increase and the process can become messy.💼 Fragmented Recruitment Processes Hiring managers engaging multiple agencies simultaneously, leading to a disjointed hiring journey. 💸 Lower Budgets - with reduced budgets it becomes harder to secure the right talent. (you get what you pay for) ⏳ Delayed Feedback - Leaner teams and shifting priorities mean recruitment often falls down the list, causing slower response times and missed opportunities. My Advice is; Streamline Recruitment Processes 🚀Limit the number of agencies you work with and establish clear communication channels to avoid duplication and inefficiencies. Adapt to Budget Constraints 💸Explore creative solutions, such as part-time roles or contractual hires, to fit within tighter budgets. Offer competitive salaries and benefits, or find creative ways to showcase non-monetary perks like career growth opportunities.

Ilya MatsiushIlya Matsiush,,"🌟 From Rejected to Recruited: My Tech Interview Comeback StorySix months ago, I faced the toughest period of my career: 8 consecutive interview rejections. My confidence was shattered, and I questioned if I should even stay in QA.The Rejection Pattern:- ""Great technical skills, but not enough leadership experience""- ""Looking for someone with more specific industry knowledge""- ""We went with a candidate who had more automation experience""The turning point came after interview #8. Instead of sending another application, I took a step back and completely transformed my approach.My Comeback Strategy:1. Targeted Application Focus Before: Applying to 15+ positions weekly After: Researching 3-5 companies deeply and customizing everything2. Technical Portfolio Creation I built a GitHub repository with: - Custom test framework examples - API testing collection - Performance testing scripts with analysis This became my secret weapon in interviews.3. Interview Narrative Shift Before: Listing responsibilities and tools After: Structuring every answer as: - Challenge faced - Action taken - Results achieved with metrics4. Interview Preparation Reboot - Recorded myself answering questions to identify weak spots - Created a ""testing philosophy"" statement - Prepared specific stories for common scenariosThe Results:Within 4 weeks of this approach, I had:- 3 final-round interviews- 2 competitive offers- 20% higher salary than my targetThe most validating moment? When the hiring manager said, ""Your methodical approach to your job search demonstrates exactly how you'd approach testing.""The rejection streak that felt like failure became the catalyst for the greatest growth in my career.hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#QACareers hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechInterviewsWhat's your biggest job search challenge right now?

Shannon HackneyShannon Hackney,Shannon.hackney@hays.com.au,"There’s no denying that it’s been a challenging market this year for job seekers especially for those in technical Life Sciences roles (Clinical, RA, QA ,PV )The ANZ market has been some what turbulent with redundancies, restructures, budget cuts, and even political shifts (hello, tariffs!) are creating uncertainty and instability across industries. I have seen this have an impact on recruitment processes, the number of applications increase and the process can become messy.💼 Fragmented Recruitment Processes Hiring managers engaging multiple agencies simultaneously, leading to a disjointed hiring journey. 💸 Lower Budgets - with reduced budgets it becomes harder to secure the right talent. (you get what you pay for) ⏳ Delayed Feedback - Leaner teams and shifting priorities mean recruitment often falls down the list, causing slower response times and missed opportunities. My Advice is; Streamline Recruitment Processes 🚀Limit the number of agencies you work with and establish clear communication channels to avoid duplication and inefficiencies. Adapt to Budget Constraints 💸Explore creative solutions, such as part-time roles or contractual hires, to fit within tighter budgets. Offer competitive salaries and benefits, or find creative ways to showcase non-monetary perks like career growth opportunities. Improve Candidate Communication 📨Keep candidates engaged by providing timely updates throughout the hiring process.Set realistic timelines to ensure a thorough and thoughtful hiring process.If you need advice on the market please don't hesitate to reach out on the details below; 📧Shannon.hackney@hays.com.au
