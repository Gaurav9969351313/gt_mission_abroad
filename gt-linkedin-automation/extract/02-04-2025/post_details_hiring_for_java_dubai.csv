She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

Conference on WheelsConference on Wheels,,"It would fill a whole article to talk about the friendship with Omar M. Almahmoud and how much I appreciate this human in my life. But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

R-FoundersR-Founders,,"How to Build a Strong B2C Sales Department in Latin America: Insights from TripleTen 🩵LatAm attracts startup founders with its market size but repels them with its uncertainty and the constant encounter with the ""mañana-mañana"" mindset, where usual ways of interacting with employees don’t work. 🫠However, there are projects that have successfully built their sales teams, such as TripleTen LatAm — an edtech company offering intensive IT courses.Alex Knyazev (Head of B2C Sales at the company) shared with the R-Founders how sales hiring works in LatAm — without illusions and with specifics.Here’s what you need to know if you plan to scale into the region and set up sales there:🍃 Who to hire: • Mexicans and Colombians — work well across Spanish-speaking markets.• Venezuelans in emigration — motivated and hardworking.• Those with experience in the US/CIS — easier to sync with processes.🍃 Who it’s difficult to hire: • Argentinians — issues with discipline and financial planning, different time zone.• Chileans and Peruvians — harder to connect and handle objections.• Venezuelans in-country — poor internet and legal restrictions.• Senior professionals with fluent English — can be easily poached by US companies.🍃 What works in offers: • Salary below the cost of living to motivate closing deals.• Total income 20–30% higher than market rates, if it fits your economics.• Supportive and respectful company culture.• Small talk and a personal connection during interviews.At the meeting, Sasha shared a hack for how they managed to boost conversion rates over the past year — join our working groups (http://r-founders.com/ru), all the details are there. 🐅Have you already built a sales department abroad?

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3. And each jurisdiction brought its own unique strengthsThat’s why MENA region today is a leaderIt’s a regulatory trendsetter.Big thank you to Saqr Ereiqat for joining our podcast with my co-host Demetrios Zamboglou PhD.

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3. And each jurisdiction brought its own unique strengthsThat’s why MENA region today is a leaderIt’s a regulatory trendsetter.Big thank you to Saqr Ereiqat for joining our podcast with my co-host Demetrios Zamboglou PhD.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Olga ProzorovaOlga Prozorova,,"Регион MENA глазами Executive Search-команды.Про MENA сегодня говорят все. Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream.

Conference on WheelsConference on Wheels,,"It would fill a whole article to talk about the friendship with Omar M. Almahmoud and how much I appreciate this human in my life. But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way. Embark on this other world with me, if just for this hour—I promise you, it will make a difference for you.Apr 7–11 | The Next Horizon TourA virtual world trip of innovation.From the US to Hong Kong.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

Lawyers in UAELawyers in UAE,,"Navigating UAE M&A: key insights & structures 🤝The UAE's growing status as a global business hub is fueling M&A activity. Understanding the legal landscape and transaction structures is crucial for investors. Here's a concise overview:🔑 Key Legal Considerations:•Dual Legal System: Federal laws country-wide + Emirate-specific regulations (mainly civil/real estate).•Free Zones: each (e.g., DIFC, ADGM) has its own rules, often common law-based.•Foreign Ownership: historically restricted, but liberalization is occurring, especially in Free Zones. Stay updated!🛠️ Common M&A Structures:•Share Acquisition: buy shares for full company control (assets, liabilities, etc.).•Asset Acquisition: purchase specific assets; target company structure remains.•Merger: combine entities into one, altering legal/corporate structure.•Joint Ventures: create a new entity for specific projects, partners retain separate identities.•Takeovers: acquire controlling stake (can be friendly or hostile).🚀 Opportunities & Nuances:While navigating the legal framework requires expertise, UAE M&A offers:•Market expansion & diversification.•Access to talent & innovation.In short, success in UAE M&A hinges on grasping the legal complexities and choosing the right transaction structure.

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3. And each jurisdiction brought its own unique strengthsThat’s why MENA region today is a leaderIt’s a regulatory trendsetter.Big thank you to Saqr Ereiqat for joining our podcast with my co-host Demetrios Zamboglou PhD.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Olga ProzorovaOlga Prozorova,,"Регион MENA глазами Executive Search-команды.Про MENA сегодня говорят все. Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

R-FoundersR-Founders,,"How to Build a Strong B2C Sales Department in Latin America: Insights from TripleTen 🩵LatAm attracts startup founders with its market size but repels them with its uncertainty and the constant encounter with the ""mañana-mañana"" mindset, where usual ways of interacting with employees don’t work. 🫠However, there are projects that have successfully built their sales teams, such as TripleTen LatAm — an edtech company offering intensive IT courses.Alex Knyazev (Head of B2C Sales at the company) shared with the R-Founders how sales hiring works in LatAm — without illusions and with specifics.Here’s what you need to know if you plan to scale into the region and set up sales there:🍃 Who to hire: • Mexicans and Colombians — work well across Spanish-speaking markets.• Venezuelans in emigration — motivated and hardworking.• Those with experience in the US/CIS — easier to sync with processes.🍃 Who it’s difficult to hire: • Argentinians — issues with discipline and financial planning, different time zone.• Chileans and Peruvians — harder to connect and handle objections.• Venezuelans in-country — poor internet and legal restrictions.• Senior professionals with fluent English — can be easily poached by US companies.🍃 What works in offers: • Salary below the cost of living to motivate closing deals.• Total income 20–30% higher than market rates, if it fits your economics.• Supportive and respectful company culture.• Small talk and a personal connection during interviews.At the meeting, Sasha shared a hack for how they managed to boost conversion rates over the past year — join our working groups (http://r-founders.com/ru), all the details are there. 🐅Have you already built a sales department abroad?

Conference on WheelsConference on Wheels,,"It would fill a whole article to talk about the friendship with Omar M. Almahmoud and how much I appreciate this human in my life. But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond).

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Olga ProzorovaOlga Prozorova,,"Регион MENA глазами Executive Search-команды.Про MENA сегодня говорят все. Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3. And each jurisdiction brought its own unique strengthsThat’s why MENA region today is a leaderIt’s a regulatory trendsetter.Big thank you to Saqr Ereiqat for joining our podcast with my co-host Demetrios Zamboglou PhD.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

That affordability opens doors for global buyers, yet a single figure never tells the whole story.• 𝗩𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗲.

Conference on WheelsConference on Wheels,,"It would fill a whole article to talk about the friendship with Omar M. Almahmoud and how much I appreciate this human in my life. But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way. Embark on this other world with me, if just for this hour—I promise you, it will make a difference for you.Apr 7–11 | The Next Horizon TourA virtual world trip of innovation.From the US to Hong Kong.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

"Michaela Ernst, MBAMichaela Ernst, MBA",,"💡4 Days in Dubai. How I gained new insights into the future of innovation, diversity, and female leadership.CAREER WOMEN in the UAE?It’s easy to jump to conclusions – biases, stereotypes, concerns.When I received an invitation to take part in the WOMEN IN DUBAI  interview series – reporting on some of the most successful and innovative women in the region – I was curious. But also critical.Then I arrived… and everything was different.Open. Progressive. Inspiring.4 days in Dubai weren’t just about visiting the Museum of the Future or standing on top of the Burj Khalifa – it was a journey into the future of agriculture, finance, medicine, entrepreneurship, space life, and of course: education.🚀 Here are a few of the key takeaways that stuck with me (...and there will be more in the days to come😉):🔹 Keep it hashtag#simple: Starting a business here is not an uphill battle – you can launch in a week. No bureaucratic beasts involved. If you want to attract young, innovative minds, give them an easy entry point.🔹 hashtag#Infrastructure matters: Hub71 – a vibrant space for young innovators – offers founders not just office space & networking, but also funding and access to affordable housing.🔹 hashtag#Diversity drives progress: 90% of the population are expats from all over the world. This cultural mix makes the city fast, creative, and highly productive.🔹And what impressed me most:👩‍👧‍👦 hashtag#workingmoms are simply part of the system.School bus fleets, a wide range of domestic & care services – and most importantly: no judgment when women choose to build a career and raise a family.🙏 🙏Huge thanks to Joumana Saad from Business Dubai/Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, who created this tailor-made program for me, and to all the inspiring people I had the chance to speak with – you opened new perspectives and encouraged me to keep thinking big.

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Olga ProzorovaOlga Prozorova,,"Регион MENA глазами Executive Search-команды.Про MENA сегодня говорят все. Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

Имах възможността да участвам както като лектор с индивидуална тема, така и в панелна дискусия с Syzan Asad, GCDF, посветена на предизвикателствата при подбора и ангажирането на поколенията Z и Alpha.Благодаря искрено на всички от аудиторията, които се включиха активно с въпроси и коментари в дискусиите около ключови теми като:➡️ Конкретни подходи за изграждане на съвременни стратегии за подбор.➡️ Основните „препъни-камъни“, които могат да възпрепятстват усилията ни да открием и задържим правилния талант.➡️ Ролята на добрия candidate experience и как да структурираме ефективно функциите около подбора, така че стратегиите ни за привличане на таланти да бъдат устойчиви във времето.‼️ Най-ценното за мен от тази среща? Осъзнаването, че без истински ангажимент и разбиране на пазара на труда няма как да отговорим на очакванията към нас. Светът се променя. Работата ни също. AI, автоматизацията и уменията за работа с данни вече са част от HR реалността.Надявам се всеки си е тръгнал с нещо малко – но важно. Точно онова, от което има нужда в този момент.hashtag#HRSUMMIT hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#AI hashtag#FutureofWork hashtag#Talent

Nour AlSaberNour AlSaber,,"Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Real Estate? 🏡💰When comparing global cities, Dubai offers the most space for your money—far more than other top-tier locations:📍 Monaco – 183 sq. ft.📍 Hong Kong – 226 sq. ft.📍 New York – 355 sq. ft.📍 London & Singapore – 366 sq. ft.📍 Geneva – 398 sq. ft.📍 Los Angeles – 420 sq. ft.📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That’s 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs. But where you invest in Dubai matters just as much as the size of the property you get.Off-Plan vs Secondary – What’s the Best Strategy?💡 Off-Plan (New Developments):- Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.- Property appreciates 30-40% by handover (typically in 3 years).- Continues to appreciate 7-10% annually after completion.- Start earning 7-8% rental yield once completed.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):- Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).- More stable, but lower capital appreciation (~5-7% per year).- Higher upfront costs and potential maintenance expenses.A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary💰 Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60%)✅ By completion, property value rises to ~$1.35M (35% increase)✅ Final $400K payment on handover✅ Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M- Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K- Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return)🏡 Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ You pay 100% upfront✅ Rental income starts immediately at $70K per year (7%)✅ Property appreciates at ~5-7% per year📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M- Total Rental Income: ~$490K- Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)Key Takeaways📌 Off-Plan Requires Less Upfront Capital (60% during construction)📌 Higher Capital Growth in the Long Run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x)📌 Secondary Provides Immediate Cash Flow but lower appreciation👉 The off-plan investment grows faster, requires less upfront capital, and gives you a higher-value asset upon completion.Dubai isn’t just about affordability—it’s about strategic investment in a market that’s growing rapidly.P.S. - Want to learn more about choosing the top real estate opportunities in Dubai?

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020.

Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

Имах възможността да участвам както като лектор с индивидуална тема, така и в панелна дискусия с Syzan Asad, GCDF, посветена на предизвикателствата при подбора и ангажирането на поколенията Z и Alpha.Благодаря искрено на всички от аудиторията, които се включиха активно с въпроси и коментари в дискусиите около ключови теми като:➡️ Конкретни подходи за изграждане на съвременни стратегии за подбор.➡️ Основните „препъни-камъни“, които могат да възпрепятстват усилията ни да открием и задържим правилния талант.➡️ Ролята на добрия candidate experience и как да структурираме ефективно функциите около подбора, така че стратегиите ни за привличане на таланти да бъдат устойчиви във времето.‼️ Най-ценното за мен от тази среща? Осъзнаването, че без истински ангажимент и разбиране на пазара на труда няма как да отговорим на очакванията към нас. Светът се променя. Работата ни също. AI, автоматизацията и уменията за работа с данни вече са част от HR реалността.Надявам се всеки си е тръгнал с нещо малко – но важно. Точно онова, от което има нужда в този момент.hashtag#HRSUMMIT hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#AI hashtag#FutureofWork hashtag#Talent

Nour AlSaberNour AlSaber,,"Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Real Estate? 🏡💰When comparing global cities, Dubai offers the most space for your money—far more than other top-tier locations:📍 Monaco – 183 sq. ft.📍 Hong Kong – 226 sq. ft.📍 New York – 355 sq. ft.📍 London & Singapore – 366 sq. ft.📍 Geneva – 398 sq. ft.📍 Los Angeles – 420 sq. ft.📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That’s 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs. But where you invest in Dubai matters just as much as the size of the property you get.Off-Plan vs Secondary – What’s the Best Strategy?💡 Off-Plan (New Developments):- Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.- Property appreciates 30-40% by handover (typically in 3 years).- Continues to appreciate 7-10% annually after completion.- Start earning 7-8% rental yield once completed.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):- Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).- More stable, but lower capital appreciation (~5-7% per year).- Higher upfront costs and potential maintenance expenses.A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary💰 Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60%)✅ By completion, property value rises to ~$1.35M (35% increase)✅ Final $400K payment on handover✅ Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M- Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K- Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return)🏡 Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ You pay 100% upfront✅ Rental income starts immediately at $70K per year (7%)✅ Property appreciates at ~5-7% per year📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M- Total Rental Income: ~$490K- Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)Key Takeaways📌 Off-Plan Requires Less Upfront Capital (60% during construction)📌 Higher Capital Growth in the Long Run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x)📌 Secondary Provides Immediate Cash Flow but lower appreciation👉 The off-plan investment grows faster, requires less upfront capital, and gives you a higher-value asset upon completion.Dubai isn’t just about affordability—it’s about strategic investment in a market that’s growing rapidly.P.S. - Want to learn more about choosing the top real estate opportunities in Dubai?

I was just another agent, trying to find my place in the industry. But today, I stand shoulder to shoulder with the best brokers in the UAE, holding two of the most prestigious titles in real estate:🏅 SuperAgent by Property Finder – A badge earned by only the most trusted, knowledgeable, and high-performing agents in the UAE.🏅 TruBroker by Bayut – A mark of excellence given to brokers who provide exceptional service, high-quality listings, and unmatched responsiveness.This transformation didn’t happen by chance. It was built on relentless discipline, sleepless nights, and an unbreakable will to win. But I didn’t do it alone.🔹 To my bosses and mentors—Mr. Furqan, Mr. Kamran, Mr. Khan, Mr. Mustafa, Mr. Ahmer —you saw potential in me when I doubted myself.🔹 To my family—my parents, my wife, and my kids—you stood by me through the struggle, believing in my vision before the world recognized it.🔹 To my clients—thank you for trusting me with one of life’s biggest investments.Achieving the 🏅TruBroker and 🏅SuperAgent milestones would not have been possible without the invaluable support of Miss Maryam and Mr. Danyal, whose expertise, motivation, and continuous updates have kept me on the right track.🏆 Success isn’t about how long you’ve been in the game—it’s about how hard you’re willing to play. One year ago, I started from nothing.

She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Olga ProzorovaOlga Prozorova,,"Регион MENA глазами Executive Search-команды.Про MENA сегодня говорят все. Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

Aleksandar BaldzhievAleksandar Baldzhiev,,"""HR e само функция на мениджмънта"" - ❌ - грешка.Ще се съгласите ли с това твърдение? Аз – не. Последното издание на HR SUMMIT Bulgaria 2025, организирано от To The Top Agency, събра над 300 професионалисти от бранша, пред които се опитах да защитя именно тази теза. Имах възможността да участвам както като лектор с индивидуална тема, така и в панелна дискусия с Syzan Asad, GCDF, посветена на предизвикателствата при подбора и ангажирането на поколенията Z и Alpha.Благодаря искрено на всички от аудиторията, които се включиха активно с въпроси и коментари в дискусиите около ключови теми като:➡️ Конкретни подходи за изграждане на съвременни стратегии за подбор.➡️ Основните „препъни-камъни“, които могат да възпрепятстват усилията ни да открием и задържим правилния талант.➡️ Ролята на добрия candidate experience и как да структурираме ефективно функциите около подбора, така че стратегиите ни за привличане на таланти да бъдат устойчиви във времето.‼️ Най-ценното за мен от тази среща? Осъзнаването, че без истински ангажимент и разбиране на пазара на труда няма как да отговорим на очакванията към нас. Светът се променя. Работата ни също. AI, автоматизацията и уменията за работа с данни вече са част от HR реалността.Надявам се всеки си е тръгнал с нещо малко – но важно. Точно онова, от което има нужда в този момент.hashtag#HRSUMMIT hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#AI hashtag#FutureofWork hashtag#Talent

Nour AlSaberNour AlSaber,,"Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Real Estate? 🏡💰When comparing global cities, Dubai offers the most space for your money—far more than other top-tier locations:📍 Monaco – 183 sq. ft.📍 Hong Kong – 226 sq. ft.📍 New York – 355 sq. ft.📍 London & Singapore – 366 sq. ft.📍 Geneva – 398 sq. ft.📍 Los Angeles – 420 sq. ft.📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That’s 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs. But where you invest in Dubai matters just as much as the size of the property you get.Off-Plan vs Secondary – What’s the Best Strategy?💡 Off-Plan (New Developments):- Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.- Property appreciates 30-40% by handover (typically in 3 years).- Continues to appreciate 7-10% annually after completion.- Start earning 7-8% rental yield once completed.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):- Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).- More stable, but lower capital appreciation (~5-7% per year).- Higher upfront costs and potential maintenance expenses.A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary💰 Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60%)✅ By completion, property value rises to ~$1.35M (35% increase)✅ Final $400K payment on handover✅ Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M- Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K- Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return)🏡 Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ You pay 100% upfront✅ Rental income starts immediately at $70K per year (7%)✅ Property appreciates at ~5-7% per year📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M- Total Rental Income: ~$490K- Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)Key Takeaways📌 Off-Plan Requires Less Upfront Capital (60% during construction)📌 Higher Capital Growth in the Long Run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x)📌 Secondary Provides Immediate Cash Flow but lower appreciation👉 The off-plan investment grows faster, requires less upfront capital, and gives you a higher-value asset upon completion.Dubai isn’t just about affordability—it’s about strategic investment in a market that’s growing rapidly.P.S. - Want to learn more about choosing the top real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season.

That means investors can now co-own real estate in new, secure, and more accessible ways.I broke it all down in my latest article on Annahar Newspaper explaining what this means not just for Dubai, but for the region—and for every person.What’s in it for you? •	Own a fraction of a property instead of the whole thing. •	More transparency, more security. •	A smarter, tech-driven investment model that could inspire change in our countries and beyond.The digital transformation is no longer coming.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Olga ProzorovaOlga Prozorova,,"Регион MENA глазами Executive Search-команды.Про MENA сегодня говорят все. Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

"Michaela Ernst, MBAMichaela Ernst, MBA",,"💡4 Days in Dubai. How I gained new insights into the future of innovation, diversity, and female leadership.CAREER WOMEN in the UAE?It’s easy to jump to conclusions – biases, stereotypes, concerns.When I received an invitation to take part in the WOMEN IN DUBAI  interview series – reporting on some of the most successful and innovative women in the region – I was curious. But also critical.Then I arrived… and everything was different.Open. Progressive. Inspiring.4 days in Dubai weren’t just about visiting the Museum of the Future or standing on top of the Burj Khalifa – it was a journey into the future of agriculture, finance, medicine, entrepreneurship, space life, and of course: education.🚀 Here are a few of the key takeaways that stuck with me (...and there will be more in the days to come😉):🔹 Keep it hashtag#simple: Starting a business here is not an uphill battle – you can launch in a week. No bureaucratic beasts involved. If you want to attract young, innovative minds, give them an easy entry point.🔹 hashtag#Infrastructure matters: Hub71 – a vibrant space for young innovators – offers founders not just office space & networking, but also funding and access to affordable housing.🔹 hashtag#Diversity drives progress: 90% of the population are expats from all over the world. This cultural mix makes the city fast, creative, and highly productive.🔹And what impressed me most:👩‍👧‍👦 hashtag#workingmoms are simply part of the system.School bus fleets, a wide range of domestic & care services – and most importantly: no judgment when women choose to build a career and raise a family.🙏 🙏Huge thanks to Joumana Saad from Business Dubai/Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, who created this tailor-made program for me, and to all the inspiring people I had the chance to speak with – you opened new perspectives and encouraged me to keep thinking big.

Aleksandar BaldzhievAleksandar Baldzhiev,,"""HR e само функция на мениджмънта"" - ❌ - грешка.Ще се съгласите ли с това твърдение? Аз – не. Последното издание на HR SUMMIT Bulgaria 2025, организирано от To The Top Agency, събра над 300 професионалисти от бранша, пред които се опитах да защитя именно тази теза. Имах възможността да участвам както като лектор с индивидуална тема, така и в панелна дискусия с Syzan Asad, GCDF, посветена на предизвикателствата при подбора и ангажирането на поколенията Z и Alpha.Благодаря искрено на всички от аудиторията, които се включиха активно с въпроси и коментари в дискусиите около ключови теми като:➡️ Конкретни подходи за изграждане на съвременни стратегии за подбор.➡️ Основните „препъни-камъни“, които могат да възпрепятстват усилията ни да открием и задържим правилния талант.➡️ Ролята на добрия candidate experience и как да структурираме ефективно функциите около подбора, така че стратегиите ни за привличане на таланти да бъдат устойчиви във времето.‼️ Най-ценното за мен от тази среща? Осъзнаването, че без истински ангажимент и разбиране на пазара на труда няма как да отговорим на очакванията към нас. Светът се променя. Работата ни също. AI, автоматизацията и уменията за работа с данни вече са част от HR реалността.Надявам се всеки си е тръгнал с нещо малко – но важно.

Nour AlSaberNour AlSaber,,"Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Real Estate? 🏡💰When comparing global cities, Dubai offers the most space for your money—far more than other top-tier locations:📍 Monaco – 183 sq. ft.📍 Hong Kong – 226 sq. ft.📍 New York – 355 sq. ft.📍 London & Singapore – 366 sq. ft.📍 Geneva – 398 sq. ft.📍 Los Angeles – 420 sq. ft.📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That’s 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs. But where you invest in Dubai matters just as much as the size of the property you get.Off-Plan vs Secondary – What’s the Best Strategy?💡 Off-Plan (New Developments):- Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.- Property appreciates 30-40% by handover (typically in 3 years).- Continues to appreciate 7-10% annually after completion.- Start earning 7-8% rental yield once completed.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):- Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).- More stable, but lower capital appreciation (~5-7% per year).- Higher upfront costs and potential maintenance expenses.A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary💰 Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60%)✅ By completion, property value rises to ~$1.35M (35% increase)✅ Final $400K payment on handover✅ Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M- Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K- Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return)🏡 Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ You pay 100% upfront✅ Rental income starts immediately at $70K per year (7%)✅ Property appreciates at ~5-7% per year📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M- Total Rental Income: ~$490K- Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)Key Takeaways📌 Off-Plan Requires Less Upfront Capital (60% during construction)📌 Higher Capital Growth in the Long Run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x)📌 Secondary Provides Immediate Cash Flow but lower appreciation👉 The off-plan investment grows faster, requires less upfront capital, and gives you a higher-value asset upon completion.Dubai isn’t just about affordability—it’s about strategic investment in a market that’s growing rapidly.P.S. - Want to learn more about choosing the top real estate opportunities in Dubai?

R-FoundersR-Founders,,"How to Build a Strong B2C Sales Department in Latin America: Insights from TripleTen 🩵LatAm attracts startup founders with its market size but repels them with its uncertainty and the constant encounter with the ""mañana-mañana"" mindset, where usual ways of interacting with employees don’t work. 🫠However, there are projects that have successfully built their sales teams, such as TripleTen LatAm — an edtech company offering intensive IT courses.Alex Knyazev (Head of B2C Sales at the company) shared with the R-Founders how sales hiring works in LatAm — without illusions and with specifics.Here’s what you need to know if you plan to scale into the region and set up sales there:🍃 Who to hire: • Mexicans and Colombians — work well across Spanish-speaking markets.• Venezuelans in emigration — motivated and hardworking.• Those with experience in the US/CIS — easier to sync with processes.🍃 Who it’s difficult to hire: • Argentinians — issues with discipline and financial planning, different time zone.• Chileans and Peruvians — harder to connect and handle objections.• Venezuelans in-country — poor internet and legal restrictions.• Senior professionals with fluent English — can be easily poached by US companies.🍃 What works in offers: • Salary below the cost of living to motivate closing deals.• Total income 20–30% higher than market rates, if it fits your economics.• Supportive and respectful company culture.• Small talk and a personal connection during interviews.At the meeting, Sasha shared a hack for how they managed to boost conversion rates over the past year — join our working groups (http://r-founders.com/ru), all the details are there. 🐅Have you already built a sales department abroad?

Conference on WheelsConference on Wheels,,"It would fill a whole article to talk about the friendship with Omar M. Almahmoud and how much I appreciate this human in my life. But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE.

Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

Последното издание на HR SUMMIT Bulgaria 2025, организирано от To The Top Agency, събра над 300 професионалисти от бранша, пред които се опитах да защитя именно тази теза. Имах възможността да участвам както като лектор с индивидуална тема, така и в панелна дискусия с Syzan Asad, GCDF, посветена на предизвикателствата при подбора и ангажирането на поколенията Z и Alpha.Благодаря искрено на всички от аудиторията, които се включиха активно с въпроси и коментари в дискусиите около ключови теми като:➡️ Конкретни подходи за изграждане на съвременни стратегии за подбор.➡️ Основните „препъни-камъни“, които могат да възпрепятстват усилията ни да открием и задържим правилния талант.➡️ Ролята на добрия candidate experience и как да структурираме ефективно функциите около подбора, така че стратегиите ни за привличане на таланти да бъдат устойчиви във времето.‼️ Най-ценното за мен от тази среща? Осъзнаването, че без истински ангажимент и разбиране на пазара на труда няма как да отговорим на очакванията към нас. Светът се променя. Работата ни също. AI, автоматизацията и уменията за работа с данни вече са част от HR реалността.Надявам се всеки си е тръгнал с нещо малко – но важно.

Nour AlSaberNour AlSaber,,"Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Real Estate? 🏡💰When comparing global cities, Dubai offers the most space for your money—far more than other top-tier locations:📍 Monaco – 183 sq. ft.📍 Hong Kong – 226 sq. ft.📍 New York – 355 sq. ft.📍 London & Singapore – 366 sq. ft.📍 Geneva – 398 sq. ft.📍 Los Angeles – 420 sq. ft.📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That’s 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs. But where you invest in Dubai matters just as much as the size of the property you get.Off-Plan vs Secondary – What’s the Best Strategy?💡 Off-Plan (New Developments):- Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.- Property appreciates 30-40% by handover (typically in 3 years).- Continues to appreciate 7-10% annually after completion.- Start earning 7-8% rental yield once completed.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):- Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).- More stable, but lower capital appreciation (~5-7% per year).- Higher upfront costs and potential maintenance expenses.A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary💰 Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60%)✅ By completion, property value rises to ~$1.35M (35% increase)✅ Final $400K payment on handover✅ Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M- Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K- Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return)🏡 Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ You pay 100% upfront✅ Rental income starts immediately at $70K per year (7%)✅ Property appreciates at ~5-7% per year📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M- Total Rental Income: ~$490K- Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)Key Takeaways📌 Off-Plan Requires Less Upfront Capital (60% during construction)📌 Higher Capital Growth in the Long Run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x)📌 Secondary Provides Immediate Cash Flow but lower appreciation👉 The off-plan investment grows faster, requires less upfront capital, and gives you a higher-value asset upon completion.Dubai isn’t just about affordability—it’s about strategic investment in a market that’s growing rapidly.P.S. - Want to learn more about choosing the top real estate opportunities in Dubai?

BRX GLOBAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICESBRX GLOBAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT SERVICES,,"The Silent Site: A Real Business Nightmare & How to Fix It!** Aisha had a dream—a beautiful café in Dubai. She found the perfect spot, signed the lease, and hired a contractor who promised the world. 45 days, he said. **But then… nothing.** 🚧 **Excuses. Delays. Complete silence.** 🚧 **Half-finished interiors. Wasted money. Zero progress.** Her savings were running out, rent was piling up, and the grand opening? A distant dream. But instead of giving up, Aisha made three smart moves: ✅ **Brought in a project manager** – Someone who understood contracts, permits & deadlines. ✅ **Hired specialists for critical tasks** – Instead of one unreliable contractor, she got skilled teams for interiors, MEP & finishing. ✅ **Controlled payments** – No large upfront payments. Milestone-based payouts ensured work actually got done! **Result?** 🚀 Work resumed. The café opened in time for peak season. And Aisha learned the golden rule of business: 💡 *""Problems don’t solve themselves. You take control, or they control you.""*👉 Have you ever faced a similar situation?

But as much as gratefulness is contagious, it might not really suffice to carve out an hour in your calendar to join next week's virtual world trip of innovation, featuring Omar when we ""pass by"" Dubai on Tuesday.Dubai has many reputations, depending on who you meet. Interestingly, a lot of people have coined their opinion before they even set foot in the UAE—to make their firsthand impression (well, at least virtually: next week is your chance). I usually divide this emirate into three categories of people: service people who are building the city and keeping it beautiful, expats who relocated for various reasons (job, weather, taxes...), and locals—Emiratis—who I enjoy most spending time with.Like Omar, many of them spent their childhood and years of school and university abroad—to come home with an international mindset, an impressively broad spectrum of knowledge, and grand visions of building the most interesting place to be on our pale blue dot (and apparently beyond). Smart and humble people, kind and curious—with a very clear perspective on today's world, its threats and opportunities.If you are trapped in “it is the hardest time to start anything,” you will get confused in the most positive way.

Its financial regulator issued the first license in the region — long before others caught up.Founders were already working directly with central banks.And Bahrain’s legacy in financial services created the right conditions early on.Saqr reminds us:1. The region’s success didn’t come from hype2. It came from early adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional trust3.

Both companies are 25% owned by the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan (UFRD).Morgan Stanley acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Korzinka, while Oman Investment Bank (OIB) represented a consortium of Omani investors.This marks another significant milestone for Korzinka, following the $40 million equity investment from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 2020. At that time, EBRD acquired a minority stake from Anglesey Investments PTE. LTD (Singapore), the parent company of Anglesey Food LLC, which operates Korzinka in Uzbekistan.These investments will fuel Korzinka’s ambitious expansion, with the goal of surpassing 1,000 stores in the medium term, further transforming Uzbekistan’s modern retail landscape.A testament to the region’s growing investment appeal and Korzinka’s strong market position!hashtag#Korzinka hashtag#ADUI hashtag#UzOman hashtag#Investment hashtag#PrivateEquity hashtag#Uzbekistan hashtag#RetailGrowth hashtag#MorganStanley hashtag#OmanInvestmentBank hashtag#EBRD

Ketty L.Ketty L.,,"As global trade dynamics shift and protectionist policies — like those proposed by Trump — gain traction, European companies are being called to rethink their export strategies. The UAE emerges as a compelling alternative: a high-income market with bold national development plans (Dubai 2040, Vision 2031), world-class infrastructure, and a strong appetite for innovation and quality. For exporters seeking resilient, future-oriented markets, redirecting toward the Emirates isn’t just a smart move — it’s a strategic investment in sustainable growth and global relevance.

Olga ProzorovaOlga Prozorova,,"Регион MENA глазами Executive Search-команды.Про MENA сегодня говорят все. Кто-то только присматривается к региону, кто-то уже строит команду в Дубае или Эр-Рияде, а у кого-то — третий круг согласований по запуску офиса в Катаре.Мы с командой уже несколько лет закрываем управленческие роли в регионе, вплоть до Эдвайзоров для борда или целых С-suite линеек. Роли уникальные и челленджевые. Особенно популярными направления для бизнес-экспансии остаются ОАЭ, Саудовская Аравия, Катар.Что видим мы изнутри рынка?🔹 Два чётких трека по формированию команд.1. Часть бизнесов в поиске русскоязычных управленцев, кто уже проживает там, имеет опыт и успехи в MENA и при этом сможет встроиться в корпоративную культуру компании.2. А другие — наоборот, фокусируется на локальных лидерах, говорящих на арабском и английском, глубоко понимающих контекст страны и рынка. Такие проекты мы также успешно закрываем.🔹 Особый спрос на тех, кто может запускать проекты и направления с нуля.Наиболее востребованные роли: Бизнес-эдвайзеры, Управляющие директора, директора по развитию, маркетинг. Для цифровых бизнесов – СТО и СРО. Лидеры, которые умеют не просто управлять, а заходить в новый рынок с нуля и строить всё вживую вместе с командой.🔹 Делаем не только Executive Search.Большинству компаний для выхода/масштабирования на новый рынок требуются: Talent mapping, аналитика рынка и уровня зарплат, оценка топ-менеджеров или целых команд.Это важный этап, в котором мы сопровождаем наших клиентов.В следующих постах расскажу больше и со стороны бизнеса, и со стороны кандидатов, наши реальные кейсы. Ниже в комментарии полезные ссылки, можно посмотреть примеры и контекст, как помогали нанимать CTO, CRM-директоров, Advisory.✅ Если ваш бизнес на этапе планирования выхода в MENA или уже активно завоевывает рынок — буду рада пообщаться, обменяться опытом и поделиться, как наша экспертиза может быть полезна в рамках стадии развития вашей компании.О чем хотите спросить насчет MENA – жду в комментариях.hashtag#MENA hashtag#executivesearch hashtag#BenchmarkExecutive

Последното издание на HR SUMMIT Bulgaria 2025, организирано от To The Top Agency, събра над 300 професионалисти от бранша, пред които се опитах да защитя именно тази теза. Имах възможността да участвам както като лектор с индивидуална тема, така и в панелна дискусия с Syzan Asad, GCDF, посветена на предизвикателствата при подбора и ангажирането на поколенията Z и Alpha.Благодаря искрено на всички от аудиторията, които се включиха активно с въпроси и коментари в дискусиите около ключови теми като:➡️ Конкретни подходи за изграждане на съвременни стратегии за подбор.➡️ Основните „препъни-камъни“, които могат да възпрепятстват усилията ни да открием и задържим правилния талант.➡️ Ролята на добрия candidate experience и как да структурираме ефективно функциите около подбора, така че стратегиите ни за привличане на таланти да бъдат устойчиви във времето.‼️ Най-ценното за мен от тази среща? Осъзнаването, че без истински ангажимент и разбиране на пазара на труда няма как да отговорим на очакванията към нас. Светът се променя. Работата ни също. AI, автоматизацията и уменията за работа с данни вече са част от HR реалността.Надявам се всеки си е тръгнал с нещо малко – но важно.

Nour AlSaberNour AlSaber,,"Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Real Estate? 🏡💰When comparing global cities, Dubai offers the most space for your money—far more than other top-tier locations:📍 Monaco – 183 sq. ft.📍 Hong Kong – 226 sq. ft.📍 New York – 355 sq. ft.📍 London & Singapore – 366 sq. ft.📍 Geneva – 398 sq. ft.📍 Los Angeles – 420 sq. ft.📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That’s 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs. But where you invest in Dubai matters just as much as the size of the property you get.Off-Plan vs Secondary – What’s the Best Strategy?💡 Off-Plan (New Developments):- Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.- Property appreciates 30-40% by handover (typically in 3 years).- Continues to appreciate 7-10% annually after completion.- Start earning 7-8% rental yield once completed.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):- Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).- More stable, but lower capital appreciation (~5-7% per year).- Higher upfront costs and potential maintenance expenses.A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary💰 Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60%)✅ By completion, property value rises to ~$1.35M (35% increase)✅ Final $400K payment on handover✅ Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M- Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K- Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return)🏡 Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ You pay 100% upfront✅ Rental income starts immediately at $70K per year (7%)✅ Property appreciates at ~5-7% per year📈 After 7 years:- Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M- Total Rental Income: ~$490K- Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)Key Takeaways📌 Off-Plan Requires Less Upfront Capital (60% during construction)📌 Higher Capital Growth in the Long Run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x)📌 Secondary Provides Immediate Cash Flow but lower appreciation👉 The off-plan investment grows faster, requires less upfront capital, and gives you a higher-value asset upon completion.Dubai isn’t just about affordability—it’s about strategic investment in a market that’s growing rapidly.P.S. - Want to learn more about choosing the top real estate opportunities in Dubai?

But I didn’t do it alone.🔹 To my bosses and mentors—Mr. Furqan, Mr. Kamran, Mr. Khan, Mr. Mustafa, Mr. Ahmer —you saw potential in me when I doubted myself.🔹 To my family—my parents, my wife, and my kids—you stood by me through the struggle, believing in my vision before the world recognized it.🔹 To my clients—thank you for trusting me with one of life’s biggest investments.Achieving the 🏅TruBroker and 🏅SuperAgent milestones would not have been possible without the invaluable support of Miss Maryam and Mr. Danyal, whose expertise, motivation, and continuous updates have kept me on the right track.🏆 Success isn’t about how long you’ve been in the game—it’s about how hard you’re willing to play. One year ago, I started from nothing. Today, ALHAMDUILLAH I stand among the best.This is just the beginning. 🚀 The best is yet to come—In Sha Allah!🙏 hashtag#Alhamdulillah🏡 hashtag#DubaiRealEstate🏆 hashtag#SuperAgent💼 hashtag#TruBroker🌍 hashtag#TopBrokerUAE🚀 hashtag#LuxuryRealEstate🏠 hashtag#DubaiProperty📍 hashtag#DubaiInvestments📊 hashtag#RealEstateSuccess📈 hashtag#TopPerformingAgent💪 hashtag#GritAndGlory🏅 hashtag#RiseToTheTop🌍 hashtag#Dubai📍 hashtag#Propertynetwork🛤 hashtag#PNUAE

Meenakshi DixitMeenakshi Dixit,,"Why Are Indians Flocking to Dubai’s Property Market? A Conversation That Opened My EyesLast week, I had a call with Rajiv, an entrepreneur from Mumbai. He said, “Meenakshi, I need a property in Dubai—preferably before Ganesh Chaturthi this year"".Curious, I asked, “Why the rush?”His answer? “Dubai is the new dream for Indians. No property tax, high rental yields, and it’s just a 3-hour flight from home.”Rajiv isn’t alone. Over the past year, I’ve worked with numerous Indian investors and families eager to own a piece of Dubai. Here’s why:✔️ Strong ROI & High Rentals – Dubai offers rental yields of 7-9%, far higher than most Indian metros.✔️ Golden Visa Advantage – Invest in real estate and secure long-term residency for your family.✔️ Tax-Free Capital Gains – No property tax, no capital gains tax—a huge relief for investors.✔️ World-Class Lifestyle – Safe, cosmopolitan, with the best infrastructure.✔️ Seamless Connectivity – Frequent flights and no hassle of currency controls make it easy.Rajiv booked his off-plan unit in a prime location that evening. He told me, “I missed the Mumbai property boom. I won’t miss Dubai.”And he’s right. The numbers, the vision, and the momentum are all pointing one way—Dubai is the future.Thinking of investing in Dubai?
