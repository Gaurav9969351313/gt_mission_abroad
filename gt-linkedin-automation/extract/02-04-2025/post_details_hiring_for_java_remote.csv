Amr SharawyAmr Sharawy,,"إليك يارب أشكو ضعف قوتي، وقلة حيلتي، وهواني على الناس. يا رب، أسألك من فضلك ورحمتك، فإنه لا يملكها إلا أنت.يا رب، تعلم أن التوفيق والنتائج منك وحدك، وأن ما عليّ إلا السعي والاجتهاد. وأنا أسعى وأجتهد، ولكن الصبر وحده لا يكفي، فمن اعولهم لا يستطيعون الانتظار.لم أتأخر عن سماع أي نصيحة، ولم أبخل بأي جهد، ولكن الفرص الحقيقية لم تأتِ بعد. منذ شهور وأنا بلا عمل، والأمور تزداد تعقيدًا. الضغوط المادية والاحتياجات اليومية تثقل كاهلي، والمصاريف والفواتير والأولاد والمدارس والإيجارات والغلاء والأمراض والأعياد تزيد من همي. والضغط النفسي والاجتماعي يمزقني، ولا أرى جنيهًا واحدًا من كدي وتعبي.أرجو ، ألا تتجاهل ندائي، وتفاعل معي بجدية، لعل الله يحدث بعد ذلك أمرًا. أرجو الدعم أو التوصية أو إعادة النشر. وأنا جاهز للعمل فورًا، وأسعد بتلقي أي استفسارات حول خبراتي ومهاراتي، ومستعد لتعلم المزيد.عمرو شعراوي  +201005802137 Phone , what's up hashtag#jobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#applicationcoordinator hashtag#d365fo hashtag#erpimplementation hashtag#CRM hashtag#retail hashtag#dynamics365fo hashtag#businessanalysis hashtag#egypt hashtag#businessapplications hashtag#hiringjobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#humanresourcesrecruiting hashtag#itdirectors hashtag#itjobopportunity hashtag#itjobsearch hashtag#alexandria hashtag#helpforjob hashtag#support hashtag#itconsulting hashtag#jobseeker hashtag#sqlserverdba hashtag#jobvacancies hashtag#jobs hashtag#employment hashtag#jobs2024 hashtag#erpcoordinator hashtag#erpprojectmanager hashtag#jobseekeradvice hashtag#working hashtag#hiring hashtag#opportunity hashtag#vacancies hashtag#caeeer hashtag#recruiting hashtag#jobsinegypt hashtag#jobsearch hashtag#job hashtag#hotjobs hashtag#jobhunt hashtag#dreamjob hashtag#freelancejobs hashtag#dubaijobseeker hashtag#dreamjob hashtag#saudijobs hashtag#saudiarabiajobs hashtag#emiratescareershashtag#ساعد_تتساعد
