Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

I confidently explained each principle with textbook examples… but then came the real challenge—""𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐠𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭?""I froze. I had studied SOLID Principles, but I had never consciously thought about where I had actually used it in my work. That interview was a wake-up call! ⚡For my next opportunity, I took a different approach. Instead of just memorizing definitions, I reviewed my own code. 🧐💻 And guess what? I discovered that I had been using SOLID principles all along—without even realizing it! 😲This approach transformed my confidence in interviews! 🚀 The next time I was asked about SOLID, I didn’t just explain it—I shared real examples from my work. And that made all the difference! 💡🔥💬 My advice? Don’t just learn SOLID—go through your own codebase and identify where you're already using it.

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

Kolisetty Sai SaranKolisetty Sai Saran,,"🎯 𝐒𝐎𝐋𝐈𝐃 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐬: 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧, 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞! 🚀✨A while back, I was asked about SOLID principles in an interview. I confidently explained each principle with textbook examples… but then came the real challenge—""𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐠𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭?""I froze. I had studied SOLID Principles, but I had never consciously thought about where I had actually used it in my work. That interview was a wake-up call! ⚡For my next opportunity, I took a different approach. Instead of just memorizing definitions, I reviewed my own code. 🧐💻 And guess what? I discovered that I had been using SOLID principles all along—without even realizing it! 😲This approach transformed my confidence in interviews! 🚀 The next time I was asked about SOLID, I didn’t just explain it—I shared real examples from my work. And that made all the difference! 💡🔥💬 My advice? Don’t just learn SOLID—go through your own codebase and identify where you're already using it. It will make your explanations 10x more impactful in interviews! 🚀🎥 Resources that helped me:📌 Concept & Coding (Shrayansh Jain) : https://lnkd.in/gGwBp5-4Bonus 😊: I’m sharing a PDF I created with basic examples of SOLID principles.hashtag#Java hashtag#SOLIDPrinciples hashtag#CodingInterviews hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#Microservices hashtag#OOP hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#ProgrammingTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Developers hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#Scalability hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#InterviewPrep hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#JavaCoding hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Coding hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechSkills hashtag#JavaProgramming hashtag#CodingChallenges hashtag#PracticeCoding hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#JavaJobs hashtag#EntryLevelJobs hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#CareerSwitch hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#BackendJobs hashtag#JavaCareer hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#JavaInterviewQuestions hashtag#JavaDeveloperJobs hashtag#JavaBackend hashtag#AdvancedJava hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeWithMe hashtag#DailyCoding hashtag#LearnToCode hashtag#CodingCommunity hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#JobSwitching hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#DSA hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#LinkedIn hashtag#IndiaTechJobs hashtag#MNC hashtag#ProductBasedCompanies hashtag#ServiceBasedCompanies hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#ITCareers

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

I confidently explained each principle with textbook examples… but then came the real challenge—""𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐠𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭?""I froze. I had studied SOLID Principles, but I had never consciously thought about where I had actually used it in my work. That interview was a wake-up call! ⚡For my next opportunity, I took a different approach. Instead of just memorizing definitions, I reviewed my own code. 🧐💻 And guess what? I discovered that I had been using SOLID principles all along—without even realizing it! 😲This approach transformed my confidence in interviews! 🚀 The next time I was asked about SOLID, I didn’t just explain it—I shared real examples from my work. And that made all the difference! 💡🔥💬 My advice? Don’t just learn SOLID—go through your own codebase and identify where you're already using it. It will make your explanations 10x more impactful in interviews! 🚀🎥 Resources that helped me:📌 Concept & Coding (Shrayansh Jain) : https://lnkd.in/gGwBp5-4Bonus 😊: I’m sharing a PDF I created with basic examples of SOLID principles.hashtag#Java hashtag#SOLIDPrinciples hashtag#CodingInterviews hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#Microservices hashtag#OOP hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#ProgrammingTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#Developers hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#Scalability hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#InterviewPrep hashtag#CodingInterview hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#JavaCoding hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Coding hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechSkills hashtag#JavaProgramming hashtag#CodingChallenges hashtag#PracticeCoding hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#JavaJobs hashtag#EntryLevelJobs hashtag#FresherJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#CareerSwitch hashtag#ITJobs hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#BackendJobs hashtag#JavaCareer hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#JavaInterviewQuestions hashtag#JavaDeveloperJobs hashtag#JavaBackend hashtag#AdvancedJava hashtag#TechLearning hashtag#CodeWithMe hashtag#DailyCoding hashtag#LearnToCode hashtag#CodingCommunity hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#JobSwitching hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#DSA hashtag#SoftwareDeveloper hashtag#LinkedIn hashtag#IndiaTechJobs hashtag#MNC hashtag#ProductBasedCompanies hashtag#ServiceBasedCompanies hashtag#TechHiring hashtag#ITCareers

Patrice GauthierPatrice Gauthier,,"As a father I have to invest my time for coding tests instead of spending time with my daughter just to satisfy the lack of trust anyone in recruitment has.This is how bad the hiring experience is.But I have to do it because recruiters don't think I have 15 years of experience.Code tests are not problem solving, they test how you remember patterns. I can tell you in 15 years I never had to use Kadane, Djikstra algos and so on. It's like testing for assembly in the 90s while developers are actually using C or Java. Those tests mean many things: - Recruiters don't believe your experience, so they resort to testing to ""validate"" your experience. Though only a few of the problems faced in tests reflects in the problems of business. - Being a pro of leetcode means .. you are a pro of leetcode and have a lot of time to invest into such, not how much experience you have.- Those tests only prove you remember specific patterns to solve such problems, not the ones faced at work. They don't validate how you find solutions for problems. How do you deal with the unexpected?- The tests do not validate if a candidate knows the quirks and limitations of a language (funny there are no leet code for async code - what happens in memory when you have 500 promises and only 10 of them resolve? How does a developer think in async code?) Meanwhile Anthropic CEO says 90% of code will be written by AI.It's time that HR update its methods.The answer is simple. Have the candidate tell his work experience and how does he structure code or show him poor code and how does he improve it?  In the long run this last one will matter since you are looking for candidate that will stay for a long time no?

I confidently explained each principle with textbook examples… but then came the real challenge—""𝐂𝐚𝐧 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐠𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭?""I froze. I had studied SOLID Principles, but I had never consciously thought about where I had actually used it in my work. That interview was a wake-up call! ⚡For my next opportunity, I took a different approach. Instead of just memorizing definitions, I reviewed my own code. 🧐💻 And guess what? I discovered that I had been using SOLID principles all along—without even realizing it! 😲This approach transformed my confidence in interviews! 🚀 The next time I was asked about SOLID, I didn’t just explain it—I shared real examples from my work. And that made all the difference! 💡🔥💬 My advice? Don’t just learn SOLID—go through your own codebase and identify where you're already using it.
