Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape? What opportunities do you see emerging from the expansion of private market access to a broader investor base?The full article is available at: https://lnkd.in/dh4nEqJaJean-Marc Laventure hashtag#PrivateMarkets hashtag#UAE hashtag#FeederFunds hashtag#Funds hashtag#GCC hashtag#Dubai hashtag#AbuDhabi hashtag#UK

Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully. Which plan would you choose?hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#RealEstateTips hashtag#InvestmentStrategy hashtag#WealthBuilding hashtag#UAEProperty

Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape?

Mehrgan P.Mehrgan P.,,"📢 Understanding Dubai’s Property Payment Plans: Which One Suits You? 🏗️💰Understanding payment plans can make a big difference in your investment strategy.  Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape? What opportunities do you see emerging from the expansion of private market access to a broader investor base?The full article is available at: https://lnkd.in/dh4nEqJaJean-Marc Laventure hashtag#PrivateMarkets hashtag#UAE hashtag#FeederFunds hashtag#Funds hashtag#GCC hashtag#Dubai hashtag#AbuDhabi hashtag#UK

Mehrgan P.Mehrgan P.,,"📢 Understanding Dubai’s Property Payment Plans: Which One Suits You? 🏗️💰Understanding payment plans can make a big difference in your investment strategy.  Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape?

Mehrgan P.Mehrgan P.,,"📢 Understanding Dubai’s Property Payment Plans: Which One Suits You? 🏗️💰Understanding payment plans can make a big difference in your investment strategy.  Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

Sayan NandySayan Nandy,,"Dubai has once again redefined the global business landscape, setting a new precedent for economic leadership and innovation. In a historic move, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council, has introduced a groundbreaking reform that will shatter barriers and reshape free zone business operations forever.A New Era of Business Without BordersFor years, Dubai’s free zones have attracted top-tier global enterprises with tax incentives, futuristic infrastructure, and streamlined regulations. However, companies were constrained—confined to specific zones, unable to scale freely across the city.That limitation is now history. Dubai is removing the last obstacle to business expansion, enabling free zone companies to operate seamlessly citywide through a simplified licensing process. This bold reform tears down outdated restrictions, unleashing a future where businesses can scale, innovate, and compete without limits.The Driving Force Behind This Visionary ShiftThis strategic decision is a defining step in the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), fueling a vision to:1. Double Dubai’s economy within a decade.2. Secure a position among the top three global economic powerhouses.3. Supercharge foreign investment and global trade by eliminating barriers to growth.By modernizing its economic framework, Dubai is not just evolving—it is revolutionizing the way businesses thrive, creating a city where scaling a company is as seamless as an idea taking flight.How This Propels Dubai to Global Business Dominance1. Attracting Unparalleled Investment: The world’s most ambitious businesses can now enter Dubai with unrivaled ease, reinforcing its status as the ultimate investment powerhouse.2. Unleashing Limitless Expansion: Technology giants, logistics leaders, and manufacturing powerhouses can operate citywide, reaching new markets and forging strategic alliances.3. Accelerating Innovation & Economic Supremacy: By fostering a competitive, entrepreneur-driven economy, this policy fuels billion-dollar ideas, creates high-value jobs, and drives Dubai toward its D33 ambitions at record speed.4. Elevating Dubai as the Apex of Global Business: With this move, Dubai cements itself as the world’s most forward-thinking business capital—a city where success knows no limits.The Future is Now: Dubai’s Borderless Economy is HereThis isn’t just a policy shift—it’s an economic revolution. Dubai is forging an unstoppable, borderless business ecosystem, where companies don’t just operate—they scale, disrupt, and redefine entire industries.With this transformative vision, Dubai is the epicenter of global enterprise, a magnet for the boldest investors, and the launchpad for the world’s most game-changing businesses.This is the future of business.

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

However, financial institutions in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are exempt from this regulation.Under the new framework, companies must comply with federal and local laws, maintain separate financial records for mainland and free zone activities, and obtain additional permits if expanding beyond Dubai. The DET will issue and renew one-year licenses for businesses setting up branches in mainland Dubai and will soon release a list of permitted activities within six months.This initiative aligns with Dubai’s D33 agenda, which aims to double the city's economy to AED 32 trillion ($8.71 trillion) over the next decade, positioning Dubai among the top three global cities. The agenda also seeks to foster 30 unicorn startups, boost economic diversification, and strengthen Dubai’s status as a leading digital economy hub.With this resolution, Dubai reinforces its commitment to business-friendly policies, making it easier for companies to scale and thrive in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.hashtag#freezonebusiness hashtag#businessexpansion hashtag#dubai hashtag#d33agenda

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape? What opportunities do you see emerging from the expansion of private market access to a broader investor base?The full article is available at: https://lnkd.in/dh4nEqJaJean-Marc Laventure hashtag#PrivateMarkets hashtag#UAE hashtag#FeederFunds hashtag#Funds hashtag#GCC hashtag#Dubai hashtag#AbuDhabi hashtag#UK

Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

Sayan NandySayan Nandy,,"Dubai has once again redefined the global business landscape, setting a new precedent for economic leadership and innovation. In a historic move, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council, has introduced a groundbreaking reform that will shatter barriers and reshape free zone business operations forever.A New Era of Business Without BordersFor years, Dubai’s free zones have attracted top-tier global enterprises with tax incentives, futuristic infrastructure, and streamlined regulations. However, companies were constrained—confined to specific zones, unable to scale freely across the city.That limitation is now history. Dubai is removing the last obstacle to business expansion, enabling free zone companies to operate seamlessly citywide through a simplified licensing process. This bold reform tears down outdated restrictions, unleashing a future where businesses can scale, innovate, and compete without limits.The Driving Force Behind This Visionary ShiftThis strategic decision is a defining step in the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), fueling a vision to:1. Double Dubai’s economy within a decade.2. Secure a position among the top three global economic powerhouses.3. Supercharge foreign investment and global trade by eliminating barriers to growth.By modernizing its economic framework, Dubai is not just evolving—it is revolutionizing the way businesses thrive, creating a city where scaling a company is as seamless as an idea taking flight.How This Propels Dubai to Global Business Dominance1. Attracting Unparalleled Investment: The world’s most ambitious businesses can now enter Dubai with unrivaled ease, reinforcing its status as the ultimate investment powerhouse.2. Unleashing Limitless Expansion: Technology giants, logistics leaders, and manufacturing powerhouses can operate citywide, reaching new markets and forging strategic alliances.3. Accelerating Innovation & Economic Supremacy: By fostering a competitive, entrepreneur-driven economy, this policy fuels billion-dollar ideas, creates high-value jobs, and drives Dubai toward its D33 ambitions at record speed.4. Elevating Dubai as the Apex of Global Business: With this move, Dubai cements itself as the world’s most forward-thinking business capital—a city where success knows no limits.The Future is Now: Dubai’s Borderless Economy is HereThis isn’t just a policy shift—it’s an economic revolution. Dubai is forging an unstoppable, borderless business ecosystem, where companies don’t just operate—they scale, disrupt, and redefine entire industries.With this transformative vision, Dubai is the epicenter of global enterprise, a magnet for the boldest investors, and the launchpad for the world’s most game-changing businesses.This is the future of business. This is Dubai.

Zakiya Dhiyab Al ZakwaniZakiya Dhiyab Al Zakwani,,"What is ROI in Dubai Real Estate? 📈ROI (Return on Investment) is a vital metric that helps investors determine the profitability of their real estate investment. In simple terms, it shows how much you earn relative to what you spent on a property.How Do You Calculate ROI? To calculate ROI in real estate, divide the annual rental income by the property’s total cost (including purchase price and any additional expenses). For example, if you bought a property for AED 1 million and earn AED 50,000 annually in rent, your ROI would be 5% 📊.Why Should Investors Care About ROI in Dubai? 💡 Dubai offers an attractive ROI for real estate investors for several reasons:No Property Taxes 🚫💸: In Dubai, there are no property or capital gains taxes, which means you keep all of your rental income and profits when selling.

These areas are always in demand, making them attractive for both rental yields and capital growth.Suburban Areas: In areas like Arabian Ranches and Jumeirah Village, ROI is around 4% to 5%, but they offer great long-term stability and growth potential 🌱.Off-Plan Investments 🚧: Investing in off-plan properties can yield higher returns, sometimes between 8% to 10%, especially when the property appreciates before it's even completed.Why is ROI So High in Dubai? 💥No Property Taxes for Residential Properties 🚫💸: In Dubai, residential properties are completely tax-free! There are no property taxes or capital gains taxes, meaning that if you invest in a villa, apartment, or townhouse, you get to keep all of your rental income and profits from selling. This makes Dubai a highly attractive destination for investors looking to maximize returns from residential real estate. 🏠✨Continued Demand 🔑: A growing population, economic stability, and Dubai's global appeal mean there’s never a shortage of people looking to rent or buy.A Strong Economy 💪: With Dubai's steady economic growth, the real estate market is thriving, attracting investors from around the world 🌍Conclusion 🌟 Dubai offers incredible opportunities for real estate investors, with high ROI, no taxes, and a growing, stable market.

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape?

Mehrgan P.Mehrgan P.,,"📢 Understanding Dubai’s Property Payment Plans: Which One Suits You? 🏗️💰Understanding payment plans can make a big difference in your investment strategy.  Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

Sayan NandySayan Nandy,,"Dubai has once again redefined the global business landscape, setting a new precedent for economic leadership and innovation. In a historic move, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council, has introduced a groundbreaking reform that will shatter barriers and reshape free zone business operations forever.A New Era of Business Without BordersFor years, Dubai’s free zones have attracted top-tier global enterprises with tax incentives, futuristic infrastructure, and streamlined regulations. However, companies were constrained—confined to specific zones, unable to scale freely across the city.That limitation is now history. Dubai is removing the last obstacle to business expansion, enabling free zone companies to operate seamlessly citywide through a simplified licensing process. This bold reform tears down outdated restrictions, unleashing a future where businesses can scale, innovate, and compete without limits.The Driving Force Behind This Visionary ShiftThis strategic decision is a defining step in the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), fueling a vision to:1. Double Dubai’s economy within a decade.2. Secure a position among the top three global economic powerhouses.3. Supercharge foreign investment and global trade by eliminating barriers to growth.By modernizing its economic framework, Dubai is not just evolving—it is revolutionizing the way businesses thrive, creating a city where scaling a company is as seamless as an idea taking flight.How This Propels Dubai to Global Business Dominance1. Attracting Unparalleled Investment: The world’s most ambitious businesses can now enter Dubai with unrivaled ease, reinforcing its status as the ultimate investment powerhouse.2. Unleashing Limitless Expansion: Technology giants, logistics leaders, and manufacturing powerhouses can operate citywide, reaching new markets and forging strategic alliances.3. Accelerating Innovation & Economic Supremacy: By fostering a competitive, entrepreneur-driven economy, this policy fuels billion-dollar ideas, creates high-value jobs, and drives Dubai toward its D33 ambitions at record speed.4. Elevating Dubai as the Apex of Global Business: With this move, Dubai cements itself as the world’s most forward-thinking business capital—a city where success knows no limits.The Future is Now: Dubai’s Borderless Economy is HereThis isn’t just a policy shift—it’s an economic revolution. Dubai is forging an unstoppable, borderless business ecosystem, where companies don’t just operate—they scale, disrupt, and redefine entire industries.With this transformative vision, Dubai is the epicenter of global enterprise, a magnet for the boldest investors, and the launchpad for the world’s most game-changing businesses.This is the future of business. This is Dubai.

Zakiya Dhiyab Al ZakwaniZakiya Dhiyab Al Zakwani,,"What is ROI in Dubai Real Estate? 📈ROI (Return on Investment) is a vital metric that helps investors determine the profitability of their real estate investment. In simple terms, it shows how much you earn relative to what you spent on a property.How Do You Calculate ROI? To calculate ROI in real estate, divide the annual rental income by the property’s total cost (including purchase price and any additional expenses). For example, if you bought a property for AED 1 million and earn AED 50,000 annually in rent, your ROI would be 5% 📊.Why Should Investors Care About ROI in Dubai? 💡 Dubai offers an attractive ROI for real estate investors for several reasons:No Property Taxes 🚫💸: In Dubai, there are no property or capital gains taxes, which means you keep all of your rental income and profits when selling. A big win for investors!Rising Demand 📅: Dubai’s population continues to grow, boosting the demand for rental properties. This leads to higher rental prices and property values, further improving ROI.Capital Appreciation 📈: Areas like Palm Jumeirah and Business Bay have seen impressive property value growth over time. As the market matures, the ROI continues to improve!What’s the Average ROI in Dubai? 🏡Prime Areas: In high-demand locations like Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, the ROI can range from 6% to 8%. These areas are always in demand, making them attractive for both rental yields and capital growth.Suburban Areas: In areas like Arabian Ranches and Jumeirah Village, ROI is around 4% to 5%, but they offer great long-term stability and growth potential 🌱.Off-Plan Investments 🚧: Investing in off-plan properties can yield higher returns, sometimes between 8% to 10%, especially when the property appreciates before it's even completed.Why is ROI So High in Dubai? 💥No Property Taxes for Residential Properties 🚫💸: In Dubai, residential properties are completely tax-free! There are no property taxes or capital gains taxes, meaning that if you invest in a villa, apartment, or townhouse, you get to keep all of your rental income and profits from selling. This makes Dubai a highly attractive destination for investors looking to maximize returns from residential real estate. 🏠✨Continued Demand 🔑: A growing population, economic stability, and Dubai's global appeal mean there’s never a shortage of people looking to rent or buy.A Strong Economy 💪: With Dubai's steady economic growth, the real estate market is thriving, attracting investors from around the world 🌍Conclusion 🌟 Dubai offers incredible opportunities for real estate investors, with high ROI, no taxes, and a growing, stable market.

Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape?

Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

In a historic move, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council, has introduced a groundbreaking reform that will shatter barriers and reshape free zone business operations forever.A New Era of Business Without BordersFor years, Dubai’s free zones have attracted top-tier global enterprises with tax incentives, futuristic infrastructure, and streamlined regulations. However, companies were constrained—confined to specific zones, unable to scale freely across the city.That limitation is now history. Dubai is removing the last obstacle to business expansion, enabling free zone companies to operate seamlessly citywide through a simplified licensing process. This bold reform tears down outdated restrictions, unleashing a future where businesses can scale, innovate, and compete without limits.The Driving Force Behind This Visionary ShiftThis strategic decision is a defining step in the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), fueling a vision to:1. Double Dubai’s economy within a decade.2. Secure a position among the top three global economic powerhouses.3. Supercharge foreign investment and global trade by eliminating barriers to growth.By modernizing its economic framework, Dubai is not just evolving—it is revolutionizing the way businesses thrive, creating a city where scaling a company is as seamless as an idea taking flight.How This Propels Dubai to Global Business Dominance1. Attracting Unparalleled Investment: The world’s most ambitious businesses can now enter Dubai with unrivaled ease, reinforcing its status as the ultimate investment powerhouse.2. Unleashing Limitless Expansion: Technology giants, logistics leaders, and manufacturing powerhouses can operate citywide, reaching new markets and forging strategic alliances.3. Accelerating Innovation & Economic Supremacy: By fostering a competitive, entrepreneur-driven economy, this policy fuels billion-dollar ideas, creates high-value jobs, and drives Dubai toward its D33 ambitions at record speed.4. Elevating Dubai as the Apex of Global Business: With this move, Dubai cements itself as the world’s most forward-thinking business capital—a city where success knows no limits.The Future is Now: Dubai’s Borderless Economy is HereThis isn’t just a policy shift—it’s an economic revolution. Dubai is forging an unstoppable, borderless business ecosystem, where companies don’t just operate—they scale, disrupt, and redefine entire industries.With this transformative vision, Dubai is the epicenter of global enterprise, a magnet for the boldest investors, and the launchpad for the world’s most game-changing businesses.This is the future of business.

Zakiya Dhiyab Al ZakwaniZakiya Dhiyab Al Zakwani,,"What is ROI in Dubai Real Estate? 📈ROI (Return on Investment) is a vital metric that helps investors determine the profitability of their real estate investment. In simple terms, it shows how much you earn relative to what you spent on a property.How Do You Calculate ROI? To calculate ROI in real estate, divide the annual rental income by the property’s total cost (including purchase price and any additional expenses). For example, if you bought a property for AED 1 million and earn AED 50,000 annually in rent, your ROI would be 5% 📊.Why Should Investors Care About ROI in Dubai? 💡 Dubai offers an attractive ROI for real estate investors for several reasons:No Property Taxes 🚫💸: In Dubai, there are no property or capital gains taxes, which means you keep all of your rental income and profits when selling.

This leads to higher rental prices and property values, further improving ROI.Capital Appreciation 📈: Areas like Palm Jumeirah and Business Bay have seen impressive property value growth over time. As the market matures, the ROI continues to improve!What’s the Average ROI in Dubai? 🏡Prime Areas: In high-demand locations like Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, the ROI can range from 6% to 8%. These areas are always in demand, making them attractive for both rental yields and capital growth.Suburban Areas: In areas like Arabian Ranches and Jumeirah Village, ROI is around 4% to 5%, but they offer great long-term stability and growth potential 🌱.Off-Plan Investments 🚧: Investing in off-plan properties can yield higher returns, sometimes between 8% to 10%, especially when the property appreciates before it's even completed.Why is ROI So High in Dubai? 💥No Property Taxes for Residential Properties 🚫💸: In Dubai, residential properties are completely tax-free!

Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape?

Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

Sayan NandySayan Nandy,,"Dubai has once again redefined the global business landscape, setting a new precedent for economic leadership and innovation. In a historic move, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council, has introduced a groundbreaking reform that will shatter barriers and reshape free zone business operations forever.A New Era of Business Without BordersFor years, Dubai’s free zones have attracted top-tier global enterprises with tax incentives, futuristic infrastructure, and streamlined regulations. However, companies were constrained—confined to specific zones, unable to scale freely across the city.That limitation is now history. Dubai is removing the last obstacle to business expansion, enabling free zone companies to operate seamlessly citywide through a simplified licensing process. This bold reform tears down outdated restrictions, unleashing a future where businesses can scale, innovate, and compete without limits.The Driving Force Behind This Visionary ShiftThis strategic decision is a defining step in the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), fueling a vision to:1. Double Dubai’s economy within a decade.2. Secure a position among the top three global economic powerhouses.3. Supercharge foreign investment and global trade by eliminating barriers to growth.By modernizing its economic framework, Dubai is not just evolving—it is revolutionizing the way businesses thrive, creating a city where scaling a company is as seamless as an idea taking flight.How This Propels Dubai to Global Business Dominance1. Attracting Unparalleled Investment: The world’s most ambitious businesses can now enter Dubai with unrivaled ease, reinforcing its status as the ultimate investment powerhouse.2. Unleashing Limitless Expansion: Technology giants, logistics leaders, and manufacturing powerhouses can operate citywide, reaching new markets and forging strategic alliances.3. Accelerating Innovation & Economic Supremacy: By fostering a competitive, entrepreneur-driven economy, this policy fuels billion-dollar ideas, creates high-value jobs, and drives Dubai toward its D33 ambitions at record speed.4. Elevating Dubai as the Apex of Global Business: With this move, Dubai cements itself as the world’s most forward-thinking business capital—a city where success knows no limits.The Future is Now: Dubai’s Borderless Economy is HereThis isn’t just a policy shift—it’s an economic revolution. Dubai is forging an unstoppable, borderless business ecosystem, where companies don’t just operate—they scale, disrupt, and redefine entire industries.With this transformative vision, Dubai is the epicenter of global enterprise, a magnet for the boldest investors, and the launchpad for the world’s most game-changing businesses.This is the future of business. This is Dubai.

In simple terms, it shows how much you earn relative to what you spent on a property.How Do You Calculate ROI? To calculate ROI in real estate, divide the annual rental income by the property’s total cost (including purchase price and any additional expenses).

Konstantia GermanouKonstantia Germanou,,"Kevin, 🙏for the very interesting comment !!! I would have agreed with you by all means if you were talking for a different place. But for the 80% of Europeans outside Dubai these details are secondary. Dubai’s nomination as top investment destination has started making headlines since last year and the importance is to set your foot in Dubai We are at a super aggressive positive upside price momentum and with yields here in Europe in the majority of asset classes not passing the 3% , you understand how amazing sounds a 10% ROI . So buy buy, buy 😉What do you think 💬💬🧐

Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape?

Mehrgan P.Mehrgan P.,,"📢 Understanding Dubai’s Property Payment Plans: Which One Suits You? 🏗️💰Understanding payment plans can make a big difference in your investment strategy.  Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

Sayan NandySayan Nandy,,"Dubai has once again redefined the global business landscape, setting a new precedent for economic leadership and innovation. In a historic move, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council, has introduced a groundbreaking reform that will shatter barriers and reshape free zone business operations forever.A New Era of Business Without BordersFor years, Dubai’s free zones have attracted top-tier global enterprises with tax incentives, futuristic infrastructure, and streamlined regulations. However, companies were constrained—confined to specific zones, unable to scale freely across the city.That limitation is now history. Dubai is removing the last obstacle to business expansion, enabling free zone companies to operate seamlessly citywide through a simplified licensing process. This bold reform tears down outdated restrictions, unleashing a future where businesses can scale, innovate, and compete without limits.The Driving Force Behind This Visionary ShiftThis strategic decision is a defining step in the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), fueling a vision to:1. Double Dubai’s economy within a decade.2. Secure a position among the top three global economic powerhouses.3. Supercharge foreign investment and global trade by eliminating barriers to growth.By modernizing its economic framework, Dubai is not just evolving—it is revolutionizing the way businesses thrive, creating a city where scaling a company is as seamless as an idea taking flight.How This Propels Dubai to Global Business Dominance1. Attracting Unparalleled Investment: The world’s most ambitious businesses can now enter Dubai with unrivaled ease, reinforcing its status as the ultimate investment powerhouse.2. Unleashing Limitless Expansion: Technology giants, logistics leaders, and manufacturing powerhouses can operate citywide, reaching new markets and forging strategic alliances.3. Accelerating Innovation & Economic Supremacy: By fostering a competitive, entrepreneur-driven economy, this policy fuels billion-dollar ideas, creates high-value jobs, and drives Dubai toward its D33 ambitions at record speed.4. Elevating Dubai as the Apex of Global Business: With this move, Dubai cements itself as the world’s most forward-thinking business capital—a city where success knows no limits.The Future is Now: Dubai’s Borderless Economy is HereThis isn’t just a policy shift—it’s an economic revolution. Dubai is forging an unstoppable, borderless business ecosystem, where companies don’t just operate—they scale, disrupt, and redefine entire industries.With this transformative vision, Dubai is the epicenter of global enterprise, a magnet for the boldest investors, and the launchpad for the world’s most game-changing businesses.This is the future of business. This is Dubai.

Zakiya Dhiyab Al ZakwaniZakiya Dhiyab Al Zakwani,,"What is ROI in Dubai Real Estate? 📈ROI (Return on Investment) is a vital metric that helps investors determine the profitability of their real estate investment. In simple terms, it shows how much you earn relative to what you spent on a property.How Do You Calculate ROI? To calculate ROI in real estate, divide the annual rental income by the property’s total cost (including purchase price and any additional expenses). For example, if you bought a property for AED 1 million and earn AED 50,000 annually in rent, your ROI would be 5% 📊.Why Should Investors Care About ROI in Dubai? 💡 Dubai offers an attractive ROI for real estate investors for several reasons:No Property Taxes 🚫💸: In Dubai, there are no property or capital gains taxes, which means you keep all of your rental income and profits when selling.

These areas are always in demand, making them attractive for both rental yields and capital growth.Suburban Areas: In areas like Arabian Ranches and Jumeirah Village, ROI is around 4% to 5%, but they offer great long-term stability and growth potential 🌱.Off-Plan Investments 🚧: Investing in off-plan properties can yield higher returns, sometimes between 8% to 10%, especially when the property appreciates before it's even completed.Why is ROI So High in Dubai? 💥No Property Taxes for Residential Properties 🚫💸: In Dubai, residential properties are completely tax-free! There are no property taxes or capital gains taxes, meaning that if you invest in a villa, apartment, or townhouse, you get to keep all of your rental income and profits from selling. This makes Dubai a highly attractive destination for investors looking to maximize returns from residential real estate. 🏠✨Continued Demand 🔑: A growing population, economic stability, and Dubai's global appeal mean there’s never a shortage of people looking to rent or buy.A Strong Economy 💪: With Dubai's steady economic growth, the real estate market is thriving, attracting investors from around the world 🌍Conclusion 🌟 Dubai offers incredible opportunities for real estate investors, with high ROI, no taxes, and a growing, stable market.

Alexander O. P. BlomAlexander O. P. Blom,,"Dubai's 2040 Vision focuses on urban development and sustainability, the D33 Agenda is centered on economic growth and global competitiveness. Together, they form a holistic vision for Dubai's future. With questions about supply vs demand in the real estate market I thought it be useful to share key elements of the two.Scope and Focus:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: This is a comprehensive urban planning framework that focuses on the physical and spatial development of Dubai. It outlines strategies for land use, infrastructure, transportation, sustainability, and the allocation of resources to ensure balanced growth across the city. The plan emphasizes creating a sustainable, inclusive, and resilient urban environment.- D33 Strategy: This is an economic strategy aimed at boosting Dubai's global competitiveness and economic growth for the period 2023 - 2033. It focuses on key sectors such as trade, tourism, technology, and innovation, with the goal of doubling the size of Dubai's economy and solidifying its position as a leading global hub.Timeframe:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: As the name suggests, this plan looks ahead to 2040, providing a long-term vision for the city's urban development.- D33 Strategy: This strategy has a shorter-term horizon, targeting 2033, and is designed to accelerate economic growth and diversification within a decade.Key Objectives:1) Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040:- Enhance quality of life for residents and visitors.- Promote sustainable development and environmental conservation.- Optimize land use and infrastructure to accommodate population growth.- Develop vibrant communities and improve connectivity.2) D33 Strategy:- Double the size of Dubai's economy by 2033.- Strengthen Dubai's position as a global trade and tourism hub.- Foster innovation and attract foreign investment.- Create new economic opportunities and jobs.Implementation:- Dubai Urban Master Plan 2040: Implemented through government agencies and urban planning authorities, focusing on zoning, infrastructure projects, and regulatory frameworks.- D33 Strategy: Driven by economic policies, public-private partnerships, and sector-specific initiatives to stimulate growth in targeted industries. ComplementarityThe two initiatives are interconnected. The Urban Master Plan 2040 provides the physical and infrastructural foundation needed to support the economic goals of the D33 Agenda. For example, improved transportation networks and sustainable urban development under the Master Plan will facilitate the economic activities envisioned in the D33 strategy.

Sheik SufyanSheik Sufyan,,"Is Dubai Real Estate Market booming at a spectacular pace? 🏙️ They say it’s breaking record every month. With more investors looking to purchase the right property, how do you think one should choose?Here are few important tips that I usually share with my buyers while purchasing a residential property in Dubai:▪️ Investment Criteria:Firstly, make sure you’re aware of what your requirements, expectations and priorities are.For an investor this can either be rental returns or capital appreciation.But an end user might be looking for a better neighbourhood, conveyance to their workplace, schools etc.▪️ Price:Draft an exact idea about the amount of money you want to invest in a property. One must have enough liquidity to cover all the payment plans.▪️ Location:Finding the best location simply becomes on of the most important factors of a purchase. Buyers must be aware of infrastructure developments going to happen in the location where they are looking to purchase. They should analyze the current supply and demand of properties as well as create an estimate of the future supply inflows in that particular locality. An investor should be aware of the price per sqft of the properties in the locality and should have a better understanding of the appreciation value in the future by analyzing the infrastructure developments and government initiatives to happen in the future.For an end user conveyance to meet daily needs such as the distance from the office, school for their children etc., along with a neighbourhood that provides you a space of comfort and peaceful living could be the primary preference.▪️ Payment Plan:While selecting an off-plan property, the buyer should be aware of the payment plans provided by the developer.These payment plans are scheduled over the construction period and it should be convenient in accordance with the liquidity of the buyer. Different developers offer different sort of payment plans according to the project and their demand.▪️ Developer:Last but not least, the Developer’s profile is one of the most crucial aspects to consider while purchasing a property.The buyer should be aware of the track record of the developer such as the previous completed projects, construction timeline of the previous projects, quality of the buildings from previous projects, and whether they have an escrow account for the transfer of money.Given above are simply a few details one should consider before making an investment in real estate. There are definitely a lot other things to consider too, and this is where a property consultant comes into play.Share your thoughts!Looking to invest in this booming market?

Private Markets Group LtdPrivate Markets Group Ltd,,"UAE's Fund Industry Transformation: How Feeder Funds Are Democratizing Private Market AccessThe UAE's fund industry is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by strategic regulatory reforms that are fundamentally reshaping how funds are structured, managed, and distributed to investors across the region.The DIFC and ADGM have emerged as essential facilitators in this evolution, fostering innovative investment solutions that align with the UAE's strategic vision of becoming a global financial hub.Global asset managers are responding through strategic partnerships with UAE-based entities, with companies like Standard Chartered, Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Aditum Investment Management pioneering feeder fund structures that maintain market access while ensuring regulatory compliance. Franklin Templeton's Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC)-domiciled fund ranges exemplify this approach, offering retail investors exposure to diverse asset classes through locally compliant vehicles.Technology is proving to be a critical enabler in this rapidly evolving landscape. Standard Chartered's ViTAL platform leverages DLT/blockchain technology to enhance fund processing, while sophisticated data analytics tools improve regulatory compliance and performance measurement. These technological innovations are particularly crucial for private market investments, which typically require specialized infrastructure for administration, valuation, and investor reporting.For fund managers navigating this complex environment, independent Management Companies (ManCos) have emerged as strategic partners, offering regulatory expertise, operational efficiency, and accelerated market access. Their role is increasingly vital as the industry embraces more sophisticated fund structures and ESG-focused investment strategies.Industry research suggests UAE retail investors represent a $100 billion opportunity for private market and ESG investments, highlighting the significant growth potential in these segments. The SCA's growing list of passported funds—including specialized vehicles focused on pre-IPO technology companies, renewable energy infrastructure, and real estate opportunities—demonstrates the increasing sophistication available to UAE investors.The transformation of the UAE's fund industry represents more than regulatory change—it signifies the emergence of a mature, sophisticated market aligned with global best practices while maintaining its unique regional character. How is your organization adapting to these transformative changes in the UAE's fund landscape?

Let’s break down the two most common options:🔹 Standard Payment Plan (Construction-Linked)Payments are made in installments as construction progresses.Typically requires 20%-30% down payment upfront.Remaining payments are spread over 2-4 years.✅ Pros: ✔️ Less financial commitment at the start. ✔️ Payments align with project progress, reducing risk. ✔️ More options available from top developers like Emaar, Meraas, and Sobha.❌ Cons: ⏳ You don’t take ownership until handover. 💰 Final balloon payment can be significant.🔹 Post-Handover Payment PlanPay a portion (e.g., 40%-50%) during construction.Remaining balance is paid after handover (spread over 3-7 years).✅ Pros: ✔️ Immediate property ownership & potential rental income. ✔️ Less financial strain as payments are extended. ✔️ Offered by developers like Ellington, Danube, and Azizi.❌ Cons: 📈 Prices may be slightly higher than standard plans. 🏦 Long-term financial commitment.📊 Which Plan is Right for You? ✅ If you prefer lower upfront costs, go for a standard plan. ✅ If you want immediate rental income or flexibility, a post-handover plan might work better.💡 Smart investors weigh their options carefully.

In a historic move, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of The Executive Council, has introduced a groundbreaking reform that will shatter barriers and reshape free zone business operations forever.A New Era of Business Without BordersFor years, Dubai’s free zones have attracted top-tier global enterprises with tax incentives, futuristic infrastructure, and streamlined regulations. However, companies were constrained—confined to specific zones, unable to scale freely across the city.That limitation is now history. Dubai is removing the last obstacle to business expansion, enabling free zone companies to operate seamlessly citywide through a simplified licensing process. This bold reform tears down outdated restrictions, unleashing a future where businesses can scale, innovate, and compete without limits.The Driving Force Behind This Visionary ShiftThis strategic decision is a defining step in the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), fueling a vision to:1. Double Dubai’s economy within a decade.2. Secure a position among the top three global economic powerhouses.3. Supercharge foreign investment and global trade by eliminating barriers to growth.By modernizing its economic framework, Dubai is not just evolving—it is revolutionizing the way businesses thrive, creating a city where scaling a company is as seamless as an idea taking flight.How This Propels Dubai to Global Business Dominance1. Attracting Unparalleled Investment: The world’s most ambitious businesses can now enter Dubai with unrivaled ease, reinforcing its status as the ultimate investment powerhouse.2. Unleashing Limitless Expansion: Technology giants, logistics leaders, and manufacturing powerhouses can operate citywide, reaching new markets and forging strategic alliances.3. Accelerating Innovation & Economic Supremacy: By fostering a competitive, entrepreneur-driven economy, this policy fuels billion-dollar ideas, creates high-value jobs, and drives Dubai toward its D33 ambitions at record speed.4. Elevating Dubai as the Apex of Global Business: With this move, Dubai cements itself as the world’s most forward-thinking business capital—a city where success knows no limits.The Future is Now: Dubai’s Borderless Economy is HereThis isn’t just a policy shift—it’s an economic revolution. Dubai is forging an unstoppable, borderless business ecosystem, where companies don’t just operate—they scale, disrupt, and redefine entire industries.With this transformative vision, Dubai is the epicenter of global enterprise, a magnet for the boldest investors, and the launchpad for the world’s most game-changing businesses.This is the future of business.

Zakiya Dhiyab Al ZakwaniZakiya Dhiyab Al Zakwani,,"What is ROI in Dubai Real Estate? 📈ROI (Return on Investment) is a vital metric that helps investors determine the profitability of their real estate investment. In simple terms, it shows how much you earn relative to what you spent on a property.How Do You Calculate ROI? To calculate ROI in real estate, divide the annual rental income by the property’s total cost (including purchase price and any additional expenses). For example, if you bought a property for AED 1 million and earn AED 50,000 annually in rent, your ROI would be 5% 📊.Why Should Investors Care About ROI in Dubai? 💡 Dubai offers an attractive ROI for real estate investors for several reasons:No Property Taxes 🚫💸: In Dubai, there are no property or capital gains taxes, which means you keep all of your rental income and profits when selling.

Konstantia GermanouKonstantia Germanou,,"Kevin, 🙏for the very interesting comment !!! I would have agreed with you by all means if you were talking for a different place. But for the 80% of Europeans outside Dubai these details are secondary. Dubai’s nomination as top investment destination has started making headlines since last year and the importance is to set your foot in Dubai We are at a super aggressive positive upside price momentum and with yields here in Europe in the majority of asset classes not passing the 3% , you understand how amazing sounds a 10% ROI .
