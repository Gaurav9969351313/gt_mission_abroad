Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe?

Instead of following the traditional job application process, she used the power of personal branding and LinkedIn networking to get noticed by top employers.This interview was a game changer for me because it highlights how taking proactive steps, like building a strong LinkedIn presence and engaging with industry leaders, can open doors to job opportunities you never expected.What can you learn from Riya’s journey?Personal branding can make recruiters come to you.Networking on LinkedIn is more powerful than just applying for jobs.Consistency and visibility help you stand out in a competitive job market.If you’re an international student or job seeker struggling to secure a visa sponsored job in the UK, this video is a must watch.Watch the full interview here https://lnkd.in/dy5W5VWi hashtag#YourKnowledgeBuddy hashtag#VisaSponsorship hashtag#UKJobs hashtag#JobSearchTips hashtag#PersonalBranding hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#LinkedInNetworking hashtag#InternationalStudentsConnect with the owner of the channel, Sarika YKB , on LinkedIn .

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?

Gonçalo NevesGonçalo Neves,,"Remote jobs can save rural villages!When I was finishing my studies and searching for a job the landscape was clear. I had two options: stay in Portugal but relocate to a bigger city (Porto, Lisbon) or just leave. But I wanted to stay in my city. Why couldn’t I have opportunities in my hometown? Why were there only two or three types of jobs as my future there? So, I tried to grab what I could get my hands on and I did. It was far from perfect and borderline depressing, but I got something, then bounced twice before landing at Mediaweb Global (best decision ever).Then Covid hit, and we were all sent home. In that rather strange time, a new chapter began. Working from home gave me the freedom to choose where to grow my family. Let’s see how much it changed my life: ✳️ I stopped commuting to work, so I gained 2 hours of my day—my own time! ✳️ Not commuting cut my fuel costs from 150€ per month to 70€—I got money back too! ✳️ At home, I can focus more, and I can use my breaks to do small tasks, giving me more relaxation time at the end of the day.These are just some of the benefits, but I still try to go to the office sometimes. Even though working from home is great, it DOES NOT REPLACE working in the office—you’ll inevitably lose some things in the process.If possible, I’d choose working from home, but there should be space for a hybrid approach.With this scene I can have more options, build a house in the countryside maybe? Now more than ever I fell in control over my life.What do you guys prefer? Home, office, or hybrid?
