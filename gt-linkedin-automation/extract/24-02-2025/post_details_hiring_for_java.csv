Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"üöÄ Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications üöÄAs developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} üíª‚ú®https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"üöÄ Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications üöÄAs developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} üíª‚ú®https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"üöÄ Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications üöÄAs developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} üíª‚ú®https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} üíª‚ú®https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} üíª‚ú®https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"üöÄ Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications üöÄAs developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} üíª‚ú®https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"üöÄ Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications üöÄAs developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} üíª‚ú®https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Jubin DasJubin Das,,"I have a confession‚Ä¶ I used to start emails with ""Dear Sir/Madam."" I thought it made me sound professional.

It technically works, but everyone is confused.The hiring manager isn‚Äôt a mysterious royal figure from a medieval kingdom. They have a name.

Shivam SharmaaShivam Sharmaa,,"A few years ago, I went through a series of job interviews that didn‚Äôt go as planned. One particular rejection stung I had the skills, the experience, and great rapport with the interviewers. Yet, I didn‚Äôt get the offer. When I asked for feedback, their response was, ‚ÄúYou were great, but we went with someone who was a better fit.‚ÄùAt first, I was frustrated. What does ‚Äúfit‚Äù even mean? But after reflecting, I realized that every interview isn‚Äôt just about proving your qualifications, it‚Äôs about alignment. The right role isn‚Äôt just one where you can succeed but one where you want to grow.One lesson I‚Äôve learned through the ups and downs of job searches is that every interaction matters. A while back, a former colleague reached out, asking for a quick referral. I responded immediately, despite being in the middle of my own job hunt. That simple act of professional courtesy led to an unexpected opportunity months later proof that relationships often matter more than resumes. In a world where career moves are scrutinized, it‚Äôs easy to feel pressured to ‚Äústick it out‚Äù for the sake of optics. But here‚Äôs the truth: staying in a role that stifles your growth or damages your mental well-being isn‚Äôt a badge of honor it‚Äôs a setback. Growth isn‚Äôt about tenure; it‚Äôs about impact.If you‚Äôre navigating career transitions, remember:‚úÖ Every interview is a learning experience, not just a test.‚úÖ Rejections aren‚Äôt the end they‚Äôre redirections.‚úÖ Your well-being and professional growth should always come first.To those in the midst of a job search: Keep going. The right opportunity, the one where you belong is out there.hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Resilience hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobSearch

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Shivam SharmaaShivam Sharmaa,,"A few years ago, I went through a series of job interviews that didn‚Äôt go as planned. One particular rejection stung I had the skills, the experience, and great rapport with the interviewers. Yet, I didn‚Äôt get the offer. When I asked for feedback, their response was, ‚ÄúYou were great, but we went with someone who was a better fit.‚ÄùAt first, I was frustrated. What does ‚Äúfit‚Äù even mean? But after reflecting, I realized that every interview isn‚Äôt just about proving your qualifications, it‚Äôs about alignment. The right role isn‚Äôt just one where you can succeed but one where you want to grow.One lesson I‚Äôve learned through the ups and downs of job searches is that every interaction matters. A while back, a former colleague reached out, asking for a quick referral. I responded immediately, despite being in the middle of my own job hunt. That simple act of professional courtesy led to an unexpected opportunity months later proof that relationships often matter more than resumes. In a world where career moves are scrutinized, it‚Äôs easy to feel pressured to ‚Äústick it out‚Äù for the sake of optics. But here‚Äôs the truth: staying in a role that stifles your growth or damages your mental well-being isn‚Äôt a badge of honor it‚Äôs a setback. Growth isn‚Äôt about tenure; it‚Äôs about impact.If you‚Äôre navigating career transitions, remember:‚úÖ Every interview is a learning experience, not just a test.‚úÖ Rejections aren‚Äôt the end they‚Äôre redirections.‚úÖ Your well-being and professional growth should always come first.To those in the midst of a job search: Keep going. The right opportunity, the one where you belong is out there.hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Resilience hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobSearch

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Shivam SharmaaShivam Sharmaa,,"A few years ago, I went through a series of job interviews that didn‚Äôt go as planned. One particular rejection stung I had the skills, the experience, and great rapport with the interviewers. Yet, I didn‚Äôt get the offer. When I asked for feedback, their response was, ‚ÄúYou were great, but we went with someone who was a better fit.‚ÄùAt first, I was frustrated. What does ‚Äúfit‚Äù even mean? But after reflecting, I realized that every interview isn‚Äôt just about proving your qualifications, it‚Äôs about alignment. The right role isn‚Äôt just one where you can succeed but one where you want to grow.One lesson I‚Äôve learned through the ups and downs of job searches is that every interaction matters. A while back, a former colleague reached out, asking for a quick referral. I responded immediately, despite being in the middle of my own job hunt. That simple act of professional courtesy led to an unexpected opportunity months later proof that relationships often matter more than resumes. In a world where career moves are scrutinized, it‚Äôs easy to feel pressured to ‚Äústick it out‚Äù for the sake of optics. But here‚Äôs the truth: staying in a role that stifles your growth or damages your mental well-being isn‚Äôt a badge of honor it‚Äôs a setback. Growth isn‚Äôt about tenure; it‚Äôs about impact.If you‚Äôre navigating career transitions, remember:‚úÖ Every interview is a learning experience, not just a test.‚úÖ Rejections aren‚Äôt the end they‚Äôre redirections.‚úÖ Your well-being and professional growth should always come first.To those in the midst of a job search: Keep going. The right opportunity, the one where you belong is out there.hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Resilience hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobSearch

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Shivam SharmaaShivam Sharmaa,,"A few years ago, I went through a series of job interviews that didn‚Äôt go as planned. One particular rejection stung I had the skills, the experience, and great rapport with the interviewers. Yet, I didn‚Äôt get the offer. When I asked for feedback, their response was, ‚ÄúYou were great, but we went with someone who was a better fit.‚ÄùAt first, I was frustrated. What does ‚Äúfit‚Äù even mean? But after reflecting, I realized that every interview isn‚Äôt just about proving your qualifications, it‚Äôs about alignment. The right role isn‚Äôt just one where you can succeed but one where you want to grow.One lesson I‚Äôve learned through the ups and downs of job searches is that every interaction matters. A while back, a former colleague reached out, asking for a quick referral. I responded immediately, despite being in the middle of my own job hunt. That simple act of professional courtesy led to an unexpected opportunity months later proof that relationships often matter more than resumes. In a world where career moves are scrutinized, it‚Äôs easy to feel pressured to ‚Äústick it out‚Äù for the sake of optics. But here‚Äôs the truth: staying in a role that stifles your growth or damages your mental well-being isn‚Äôt a badge of honor it‚Äôs a setback. Growth isn‚Äôt about tenure; it‚Äôs about impact.If you‚Äôre navigating career transitions, remember:‚úÖ Every interview is a learning experience, not just a test.‚úÖ Rejections aren‚Äôt the end they‚Äôre redirections.‚úÖ Your well-being and professional growth should always come first.To those in the midst of a job search: Keep going. The right opportunity, the one where you belong is out there.hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Resilience hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobSearch
