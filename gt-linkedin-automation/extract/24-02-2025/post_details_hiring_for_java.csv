Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Edison NIYONTEGEREJEEdison NIYONTEGEREJE,,"💡 I just hired a candidate with ZERO experience. Here’s why…They showed up 5 minutes early (respect ✅), pronounced my name correctly (major kudos 🙌), and had a genuine smile while dressing sharp.During the interview, they:✅ Made eye contact and were honest about their lack of experience.✅ Asked thoughtful questions because they genuinely wanted to learn.✅ Showed enthusiasm and the hunger to grow.Too often, hiring managers disqualify candidates just because they don’t have experience. But let’s be real—experience doesn’t always mean better work ethic or stronger commitment.🔥 Sometimes, the most dedicated employees are the ones who are simply grateful for the opportunity. All they need is a leader willing to give them a chance.💭 What’s your take? Should experience be the top hiring factor, or should attitude and potential matter more?

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

But let’s be real—experience doesn’t always mean better work ethic or stronger commitment.🔥 Sometimes, the most dedicated employees are the ones who are simply grateful for the opportunity.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

But let’s be real—experience doesn’t always mean better work ethic or stronger commitment.🔥 Sometimes, the most dedicated employees are the ones who are simply grateful for the opportunity.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Edison NIYONTEGEREJEEdison NIYONTEGEREJE,,"💡 I just hired a candidate with ZERO experience. Here’s why…They showed up 5 minutes early (respect ✅), pronounced my name correctly (major kudos 🙌), and had a genuine smile while dressing sharp.During the interview, they:✅ Made eye contact and were honest about their lack of experience.✅ Asked thoughtful questions because they genuinely wanted to learn.✅ Showed enthusiasm and the hunger to grow.Too often, hiring managers disqualify candidates just because they don’t have experience. But let’s be real—experience doesn’t always mean better work ethic or stronger commitment.🔥 Sometimes, the most dedicated employees are the ones who are simply grateful for the opportunity. All they need is a leader willing to give them a chance.💭 What’s your take? Should experience be the top hiring factor, or should attitude and potential matter more?

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise. However, systemic change is needed.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

AtarjamatAtarjamat,,"Securing the Future of the UK Food Industry: The Strategic Role of ApprenticeshipsWith the UK food and beverage sector employing over half a million people and contributing £38 billion to the economy annually, the industry’s success depends on a skilled, future-ready workforce. Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise. However, systemic change is needed. The proposed Growth and Skills Levy could play a pivotal role in reforming workforce development, ensuring apprenticeships remain a strategic asset for the sector.How can businesses and policymakers collaborate to enhance the impact of apprenticeships?

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

AtarjamatAtarjamat,,"Securing the Future of the UK Food Industry: The Strategic Role of ApprenticeshipsWith the UK food and beverage sector employing over half a million people and contributing £38 billion to the economy annually, the industry’s success depends on a skilled, future-ready workforce. Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise. However, systemic change is needed. The proposed Growth and Skills Levy could play a pivotal role in reforming workforce development, ensuring apprenticeships remain a strategic asset for the sector.How can businesses and policymakers collaborate to enhance the impact of apprenticeships?

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

AtarjamatAtarjamat,,"Securing the Future of the UK Food Industry: The Strategic Role of ApprenticeshipsWith the UK food and beverage sector employing over half a million people and contributing £38 billion to the economy annually, the industry’s success depends on a skilled, future-ready workforce. Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise. However, systemic change is needed. The proposed Growth and Skills Levy could play a pivotal role in reforming workforce development, ensuring apprenticeships remain a strategic asset for the sector.How can businesses and policymakers collaborate to enhance the impact of apprenticeships?

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Edison NIYONTEGEREJEEdison NIYONTEGEREJE,,"💡 I just hired a candidate with ZERO experience. Here’s why…They showed up 5 minutes early (respect ✅), pronounced my name correctly (major kudos 🙌), and had a genuine smile while dressing sharp.During the interview, they:✅ Made eye contact and were honest about their lack of experience.✅ Asked thoughtful questions because they genuinely wanted to learn.✅ Showed enthusiasm and the hunger to grow.Too often, hiring managers disqualify candidates just because they don’t have experience. But let’s be real—experience doesn’t always mean better work ethic or stronger commitment.🔥 Sometimes, the most dedicated employees are the ones who are simply grateful for the opportunity. All they need is a leader willing to give them a chance.💭 What’s your take? Should experience be the top hiring factor, or should attitude and potential matter more?

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Jubin DasJubin Das,,"I have a confession… I used to start emails with ""Dear Sir/Madam."" I thought it made me sound professional. Turns out, it just made me sound like a time traveler from the 1800s.Because let’s be honest—""Dear Sir/Madam"" is the job application equivalent of wearing a half-suit, half-dress. It technically works, but everyone is confused.The hiring manager isn’t a mysterious royal figure from a medieval kingdom. They have a name. And trust me, they’d prefer you use it instead of making them feel like an anonymous NPC in your job search adventure.So let’s retire ""Dear Sir/Madam"" and give our applications the full, well-fitted suit they deserve. Your future self (and the hiring manager) will thank you.hashtag#JobSearchFails hashtag#RIPDearSirMadam hashtag#WriteLikeARealPerson hashtag#EmailEtiquetteMattershashtag#LinkedIn

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Edison NIYONTEGEREJEEdison NIYONTEGEREJE,,"💡 I just hired a candidate with ZERO experience. Here’s why…They showed up 5 minutes early (respect ✅), pronounced my name correctly (major kudos 🙌), and had a genuine smile while dressing sharp.During the interview, they:✅ Made eye contact and were honest about their lack of experience.✅ Asked thoughtful questions because they genuinely wanted to learn.✅ Showed enthusiasm and the hunger to grow.Too often, hiring managers disqualify candidates just because they don’t have experience. But let’s be real—experience doesn’t always mean better work ethic or stronger commitment.🔥 Sometimes, the most dedicated employees are the ones who are simply grateful for the opportunity. All they need is a leader willing to give them a chance.💭 What’s your take? Should experience be the top hiring factor, or should attitude and potential matter more?

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Shivam SharmaaShivam Sharmaa,,"A few years ago, I went through a series of job interviews that didn’t go as planned. One particular rejection stung I had the skills, the experience, and great rapport with the interviewers. Yet, I didn’t get the offer. When I asked for feedback, their response was, “You were great, but we went with someone who was a better fit.”At first, I was frustrated. What does “fit” even mean? But after reflecting, I realized that every interview isn’t just about proving your qualifications, it’s about alignment. The right role isn’t just one where you can succeed but one where you want to grow.One lesson I’ve learned through the ups and downs of job searches is that every interaction matters. A while back, a former colleague reached out, asking for a quick referral. I responded immediately, despite being in the middle of my own job hunt. That simple act of professional courtesy led to an unexpected opportunity months later proof that relationships often matter more than resumes. In a world where career moves are scrutinized, it’s easy to feel pressured to “stick it out” for the sake of optics. But here’s the truth: staying in a role that stifles your growth or damages your mental well-being isn’t a badge of honor it’s a setback. Growth isn’t about tenure; it’s about impact.If you’re navigating career transitions, remember:✅ Every interview is a learning experience, not just a test.✅ Rejections aren’t the end they’re redirections.✅ Your well-being and professional growth should always come first.To those in the midst of a job search: Keep going. The right opportunity, the one where you belong is out there.hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Resilience hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobSearch

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Edison NIYONTEGEREJEEdison NIYONTEGEREJE,,"💡 I just hired a candidate with ZERO experience. Here’s why…They showed up 5 minutes early (respect ✅), pronounced my name correctly (major kudos 🙌), and had a genuine smile while dressing sharp.During the interview, they:✅ Made eye contact and were honest about their lack of experience.✅ Asked thoughtful questions because they genuinely wanted to learn.✅ Showed enthusiasm and the hunger to grow.Too often, hiring managers disqualify candidates just because they don’t have experience. But let’s be real—experience doesn’t always mean better work ethic or stronger commitment.🔥 Sometimes, the most dedicated employees are the ones who are simply grateful for the opportunity. All they need is a leader willing to give them a chance.💭 What’s your take? Should experience be the top hiring factor, or should attitude and potential matter more?

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Shivam SharmaaShivam Sharmaa,,"A few years ago, I went through a series of job interviews that didn’t go as planned. One particular rejection stung I had the skills, the experience, and great rapport with the interviewers. Yet, I didn’t get the offer. When I asked for feedback, their response was, “You were great, but we went with someone who was a better fit.”At first, I was frustrated. What does “fit” even mean? But after reflecting, I realized that every interview isn’t just about proving your qualifications, it’s about alignment. The right role isn’t just one where you can succeed but one where you want to grow.One lesson I’ve learned through the ups and downs of job searches is that every interaction matters. A while back, a former colleague reached out, asking for a quick referral. I responded immediately, despite being in the middle of my own job hunt. That simple act of professional courtesy led to an unexpected opportunity months later proof that relationships often matter more than resumes. In a world where career moves are scrutinized, it’s easy to feel pressured to “stick it out” for the sake of optics. But here’s the truth: staying in a role that stifles your growth or damages your mental well-being isn’t a badge of honor it’s a setback. Growth isn’t about tenure; it’s about impact.If you’re navigating career transitions, remember:✅ Every interview is a learning experience, not just a test.✅ Rejections aren’t the end they’re redirections.✅ Your well-being and professional growth should always come first.To those in the midst of a job search: Keep going. The right opportunity, the one where you belong is out there.hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Resilience hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobSearch

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Shivam SharmaaShivam Sharmaa,,"A few years ago, I went through a series of job interviews that didn’t go as planned. One particular rejection stung I had the skills, the experience, and great rapport with the interviewers. Yet, I didn’t get the offer. When I asked for feedback, their response was, “You were great, but we went with someone who was a better fit.”At first, I was frustrated. What does “fit” even mean? But after reflecting, I realized that every interview isn’t just about proving your qualifications, it’s about alignment. The right role isn’t just one where you can succeed but one where you want to grow.One lesson I’ve learned through the ups and downs of job searches is that every interaction matters. A while back, a former colleague reached out, asking for a quick referral. I responded immediately, despite being in the middle of my own job hunt. That simple act of professional courtesy led to an unexpected opportunity months later proof that relationships often matter more than resumes. In a world where career moves are scrutinized, it’s easy to feel pressured to “stick it out” for the sake of optics. But here’s the truth: staying in a role that stifles your growth or damages your mental well-being isn’t a badge of honor it’s a setback. Growth isn’t about tenure; it’s about impact.If you’re navigating career transitions, remember:✅ Every interview is a learning experience, not just a test.✅ Rejections aren’t the end they’re redirections.✅ Your well-being and professional growth should always come first.To those in the midst of a job search: Keep going. The right opportunity, the one where you belong is out there.hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Resilience hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobSearch

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Why is the conflation dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Amin HosseiniAmin Hosseini,,"🚀 Unlocking Java Reflection: Modifying Private and Final Fields in Real Applications 🚀As developers, we often face challenges when we need to access or modify fields that are private or marked as final. While it may seem impossible!Using the final keyword in Java classes serves several important purposes, primarily related to immutability, design integrity, and thread safety.Why Use Reflection?Reflection allows us to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, enabling dynamic behavior that can be particularly useful in testing or configuration scenarios.Sometimes you need dirty hacks. This is one that can be useful in testing scenarios how to change fields that are not meant to be changed.If we have class Knowledge with the answer for everything:public class Knowledge { private static final Integer ANSWER = 42; public String askQuestion(String question) { return ""The answer to '"" + question + ""' is: "" + ANSWER; }}We now want to change the answer for testing purposes:public class KnowledgeTest { @Test public void testAskQuestion() throws Exception { Knowledge knowledge = new Knowledge(); String answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 42"")); setFinalStaticField(Knowledge.class, ""ANSWER"", 41); answer = knowledge.askQuestion(""question?""); assertThat(answer, is(""The answer to 'question?' is: 41"")); } private static void setFinalStaticField(Class<?> clazz, String fieldName, Object value) throws ReflectiveOperationException { Field field = clazz.getDeclaredField(fieldName); field.setAccessible(true); Field modifiers = Field.class.getDeclaredField(""modifiers""); modifiers.setAccessible(true); modifiers.setInt(field, field.getModifiers() & ~Modifier.FINAL); field.set(null, value); }}Example: Modifying Configuration Settingspublic class AppConfig { private final String apiUrl; private final int timeout; public AppConfig(String apiUrl, int timeout) { this.apiUrl = apiUrl; this.timeout = timeout; }}public class ReflectionModifyConfig { public static void main(String[] args) { try { AppConfig config = new AppConfig(""https://api.example.com"", 5000); Field apiUrlField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""apiUrl""); Field timeoutField = AppConfig.class.getDeclaredField(""timeout""); apiUrlField.setAccessible(true); timeoutField.setAccessible(true); apiUrlField.set(config, ""https://api.newexample.com""); timeoutField.set(config, 10000); System.out.println(""After: "" + config); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }} 💻✨https://lnkd.in/duay9h4Yhashtag#Java hashtag#Reflection hashtag#FinalFields hashtag#Programming hashtag#dirtyHacks

Shivam SharmaaShivam Sharmaa,,"A few years ago, I went through a series of job interviews that didn’t go as planned. One particular rejection stung I had the skills, the experience, and great rapport with the interviewers. Yet, I didn’t get the offer. When I asked for feedback, their response was, “You were great, but we went with someone who was a better fit.”At first, I was frustrated. What does “fit” even mean? But after reflecting, I realized that every interview isn’t just about proving your qualifications, it’s about alignment. The right role isn’t just one where you can succeed but one where you want to grow.One lesson I’ve learned through the ups and downs of job searches is that every interaction matters. A while back, a former colleague reached out, asking for a quick referral. I responded immediately, despite being in the middle of my own job hunt. That simple act of professional courtesy led to an unexpected opportunity months later proof that relationships often matter more than resumes. In a world where career moves are scrutinized, it’s easy to feel pressured to “stick it out” for the sake of optics. But here’s the truth: staying in a role that stifles your growth or damages your mental well-being isn’t a badge of honor it’s a setback. Growth isn’t about tenure; it’s about impact.If you’re navigating career transitions, remember:✅ Every interview is a learning experience, not just a test.✅ Rejections aren’t the end they’re redirections.✅ Your well-being and professional growth should always come first.To those in the midst of a job search: Keep going. The right opportunity, the one where you belong is out there.hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#Resilience hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JobSearch
