Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code. Seriously, if you haven't tried Cursor AI, stop what you're doing and dive in.Hiring managers and Engineering Directors, this is our wake-up call. The way we code is evolving rapidly, and the impact on team productivity is profound. We're talking about significantly accelerated development cycles. We must think about how we can strategically integrate tools like Cursor AI to empower our teams to deliver more, faster, a lot faster!!!. Understanding how these AI tools will impact your team's efficiency, future staffing, and overall project timelines is crucial. We must start building our future engineering teams with these AI tools in mind.Yes, there are concerns about job displacement. But let's focus on the opportunity: a new era of innovation. Creative minds, armed with AI, can now build software ventures previously out of reach.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code. Seriously, if you haven't tried Cursor AI, stop what you're doing and dive in.Hiring managers and Engineering Directors, this is our wake-up call. The way we code is evolving rapidly, and the impact on team productivity is profound. We're talking about significantly accelerated development cycles. We must think about how we can strategically integrate tools like Cursor AI to empower our teams to deliver more, faster, a lot faster!!!. Understanding how these AI tools will impact your team's efficiency, future staffing, and overall project timelines is crucial. We must start building our future engineering teams with these AI tools in mind.Yes, there are concerns about job displacement. But let's focus on the opportunity: a new era of innovation.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code. Seriously, if you haven't tried Cursor AI, stop what you're doing and dive in.Hiring managers and Engineering Directors, this is our wake-up call. The way we code is evolving rapidly, and the impact on team productivity is profound. We're talking about significantly accelerated development cycles. We must think about how we can strategically integrate tools like Cursor AI to empower our teams to deliver more, faster, a lot faster!!!. Understanding how these AI tools will impact your team's efficiency, future staffing, and overall project timelines is crucial. We must start building our future engineering teams with these AI tools in mind.Yes, there are concerns about job displacement. But let's focus on the opportunity: a new era of innovation.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Xiandong (Sean) SuXiandong (Sean) Su,,"Three days. Just a few hours each day. That's all it took for Cursor AI to blow my mind. This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code. Seriously, if you haven't tried Cursor AI, stop what you're doing and dive in.Hiring managers and Engineering Directors, this is our wake-up call. The way we code is evolving rapidly, and the impact on team productivity is profound. We're talking about significantly accelerated development cycles. We must think about how we can strategically integrate tools like Cursor AI to empower our teams to deliver more, faster, a lot faster!!!. Understanding how these AI tools will impact your team's efficiency, future staffing, and overall project timelines is crucial. We must start building our future engineering teams with these AI tools in mind.Yes, there are concerns about job displacement. But let's focus on the opportunity: a new era of innovation. Creative minds, armed with AI, can now build software ventures previously out of reach. The future belongs to those who embrace change, innovate, and leverage these powerful tools. hashtag#AI hashtag#Coding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CursorAI hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#TeamVelocity hashtag#DevOps

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Xiandong (Sean) SuXiandong (Sean) Su,,"Three days. Just a few hours each day. That's all it took for Cursor AI to blow my mind. This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code. Seriously, if you haven't tried Cursor AI, stop what you're doing and dive in.Hiring managers and Engineering Directors, this is our wake-up call. The way we code is evolving rapidly, and the impact on team productivity is profound. We're talking about significantly accelerated development cycles. We must think about how we can strategically integrate tools like Cursor AI to empower our teams to deliver more, faster, a lot faster!!!. Understanding how these AI tools will impact your team's efficiency, future staffing, and overall project timelines is crucial. We must start building our future engineering teams with these AI tools in mind.Yes, there are concerns about job displacement. But let's focus on the opportunity: a new era of innovation. Creative minds, armed with AI, can now build software ventures previously out of reach. The future belongs to those who embrace change, innovate, and leverage these powerful tools. hashtag#AI hashtag#Coding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#CursorAI hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#EngineeringLeadership hashtag#TeamVelocity hashtag#DevOps

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code. Seriously, if you haven't tried Cursor AI, stop what you're doing and dive in.Hiring managers and Engineering Directors, this is our wake-up call.

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code. Seriously, if you haven't tried Cursor AI, stop what you're doing and dive in.Hiring managers and Engineering Directors, this is our wake-up call. The way we code is evolving rapidly, and the impact on team productivity is profound. We're talking about significantly accelerated development cycles. We must think about how we can strategically integrate tools like Cursor AI to empower our teams to deliver more, faster, a lot faster!!!. Understanding how these AI tools will impact your team's efficiency, future staffing, and overall project timelines is crucial. We must start building our future engineering teams with these AI tools in mind.Yes, there are concerns about job displacement. But let's focus on the opportunity: a new era of innovation.

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code.

(hashtag#CHO) 🚀Esto confirma algo que en el mundo del coaching en felicidad en el trabajo sabemos bien: la felicidad de los empleados no es solo un tema “bonito”, es un buen negocio.

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code.

The way we code is evolving rapidly, and the impact on team productivity is profound. We're talking about significantly accelerated development cycles.

Understanding how these AI tools will impact your team's efficiency, future staffing, and overall project timelines is crucial. We must start building our future engineering teams with these AI tools in mind.Yes, there are concerns about job displacement. But let's focus on the opportunity: a new era of innovation.

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code.

Empresas que priorizan el bienestar de sus equipos ven más innovación, hashtag#retencióndetalento y hashtag#productividadsostenible.📌 En LATAM aún hay pocas empresas con este rol, pero eso está cambiando. en Uruguay  la empresa de desarrollo de softwares Thaloz tiene a Carla Brovetto ocupando este cargo.  ¿Conoces alguna compañía en Uruguay o la la región que ya tenga un CHO? ¡Compártanla en los comentarios! 👇hashtag#felicidadorganizacional hashtag#climalaboral

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Nobody cares about the technical stack anymore: FastAPI with Mongodb under AWS ECS? Nice. Rails with Postgres feeding a Flutter App under GCP? Give it to me,...5. DevOps is disappearing.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code.

Empresas que priorizan el bienestar de sus equipos ven más innovación, hashtag#retencióndetalento y hashtag#productividadsostenible.📌 En LATAM aún hay pocas empresas con este rol, pero eso está cambiando. en Uruguay  la empresa de desarrollo de softwares Thaloz tiene a Carla Brovetto ocupando este cargo.  ¿Conoces alguna compañía en Uruguay o la la región que ya tenga un CHO? ¡Compártanla en los comentarios! 👇hashtag#felicidadorganizacional hashtag#climalaboral

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Nobody cares about the technical stack anymore: FastAPI with Mongodb under AWS ECS? Nice. Rails with Postgres feeding a Flutter App under GCP? Give it to me,...5. DevOps is disappearing.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

This isn't just another code editor; its codebase chat is a game-changer that directly translates to increased team velocity. Software engineers, it's time to reassess everything you thought you knew about writing code.

Kannamani RKannamani R,,"🔹 7 Unique Strategies to Crack Your Azure Interview 🔹If you’re preparing for an Azure interview, don’t just memorize answers—stand out with these unique strategies!1️⃣ Decode the Job Description Like a Consultant🔍 Before applying, break down the job description into key skills:✅ Is it Infra-heavy? Focus on VMs, networking, storage.✅ Security-driven? Master Defender for Cloud, Key Vault, and SIEM.✅ DevOps-heavy? Get hands-on with Bicep, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.💡 Pro Tip: If the JD mentions “cost optimization” → Learn Azure Reservations, Hybrid Benefit & Budgets!2️⃣ Develop a “War Room” Troubleshooting Mindset🚀 In real-world cloud issues, speed matters! Prepare to troubleshoot:🔹 “My app is slow in one region, how do you diagnose latency?”🔹 “Users report 503 errors on App Gateway, what’s your approach?”🔹 “A VM keeps rebooting unexpectedly. Where do you start?”💡 Master Azure Monitor, KQL, and Resource Health to answer confidently!3️⃣ Demonstrate Your “Cloud Architecture Thinking”🔥 Many candidates know features, but few think like an architect!🔹 Instead of: “I would use a VM for hosting a web app.”🔹 Say: “For scalability, I’d use Azure App Service with Autoscale and a private endpoint.”💡 Frame every answer around scalability, security, and cost efficiency!4️⃣ Be Ready for Curveball Questions💡 Hiring managers test adaptability with uncommon scenarios:🔹 “What if Azure AD goes down—how do users log in?”🔹 “How would you design multi-cloud failover for a critical app?”🔹 “How do you prevent accidental mass VM deletion in Azure?”💡 Think beyond textbook answers—bring in real-world constraints!5️⃣ Have a Mini-Portfolio of Your Azure Work✅ Instead of saying “I know Azure,” show it!📌 Deploy a GitHub repository with your Terraform/Bicep templates.📌 Write a LinkedIn post on how you solved a real Azure issue.📌 Share an architecture diagram for a past cloud migration.💡 A candidate with proof of work always wins!6️⃣ Learn to Explain Azure in Layman Terms🚀 Can you explain Azure VMs, App Gateway, or WAF to a non-technical person?✅ Use analogies: “Azure Traffic Manager is like an air traffic controller for requests.”✅ Show simplicity + clarity → This is key for interviews at leadership levels!7️⃣ Close the Interview with a Smart Question💡 Stand out by asking something that shows curiosity:🔹 “How does your team currently handle cost governance in Azure?”🔹 “What’s the biggest cloud challenge your company faced recently?”🔹 “How do you see AI integration changing Azure security in the next few years?”💡 A great closing question makes you memorable!🔥 Final Pro Tip: Confidence comes from practice—mock interviews, hands-on labs, and deep dives into real Azure incidents will set you apart!What’s the toughest Azure interview question you’ve faced?

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

No matter the size of the project.Every developer is becoming a Product Owner and this has a lot of consequences:1. The number of new startups is exploding (nobody cares about money anymore).2. Developers are becoming cheaper and cheaper every week.3. Value was never in the technology but now this is more real than ever.4. Nobody cares about the technical stack anymore: FastAPI with Mongodb under AWS ECS? Nice. Rails with Postgres feeding a Flutter App under GCP? Give it to me,...5. DevOps is disappearing. SecOps is rising.6. SDLC is a joke today, it doesn't matter if you are disgusted about it, the Industry is pushing it's disappearance.7. Software Engineering will last forever but not all the professionals will be prepared mentally for the change the industry is pushing (and enjoying).8.
