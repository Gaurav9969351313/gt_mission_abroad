Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

The impact?• 15% faster development in mobile domain• 50% acceleration in unit test co-generation🔍 Code Review Assistance – Big wins here with CodeRabbit, GitLab Duo, and a pilot with local-based Callstack.ai. Results so far:• 30% reduction in review time• Eliminating the need for an extra reviewer🎨 AI-Driven UI Prototyping – tested rapid prototyping new UIs using Builder.io, directly integrating with Figma.In addition to that we are automating QA and other domains (stay tuned!).On top of all that, I had a great dinner with Jakub, who showed me how they’re using Devin.ai to automate ticket-to-PR workflows. While 80% of results are still unusable, the mindset shift among engineers is the real game-changer and you can well use the 20% :).While these are still proof of concepts, the impact we’re already seeing makes it clear—this is just the beginning.

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

A huge shoutout to Richard for leading the initiative:🚀 Code Development Assistants – We’ve equipped many engineers with Cursor and experimented with Windsurf, VS Cline, and Junie by IntelliJ. The impact?• 15% faster development in mobile domain• 50% acceleration in unit test co-generation🔍 Code Review Assistance – Big wins here with CodeRabbit, GitLab Duo, and a pilot with local-based Callstack.ai. Results so far:• 30% reduction in review time• Eliminating the need for an extra reviewer🎨 AI-Driven UI Prototyping – tested rapid prototyping new UIs using Builder.io, directly integrating with Figma.In addition to that we are automating QA and other domains (stay tuned!).On top of all that, I had a great dinner with Jakub, who showed me how they’re using Devin.ai to automate ticket-to-PR workflows. While 80% of results are still unusable, the mindset shift among engineers is the real game-changer and you can well use the 20% :).While these are still proof of concepts, the impact we’re already seeing makes it clear—this is just the beginning.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

David PavlikDavid Pavlik,,"What a week with AI at Rohlik Tech Team! The speed at which we’re adopting and integrating AI tools is truly game-changing. A huge shoutout to Richard for leading the initiative:🚀 Code Development Assistants – We’ve equipped many engineers with Cursor and experimented with Windsurf, VS Cline, and Junie by IntelliJ. The impact?• 15% faster development in mobile domain• 50% acceleration in unit test co-generation🔍 Code Review Assistance – Big wins here with CodeRabbit, GitLab Duo, and a pilot with local-based Callstack.ai. Results so far:• 30% reduction in review time• Eliminating the need for an extra reviewer🎨 AI-Driven UI Prototyping – tested rapid prototyping new UIs using Builder.io, directly integrating with Figma.In addition to that we are automating QA and other domains (stay tuned!).On top of all that, I had a great dinner with Jakub, who showed me how they’re using Devin.ai to automate ticket-to-PR workflows. While 80% of results are still unusable, the mindset shift among engineers is the real game-changer and you can well use the 20% :).While these are still proof of concepts, the impact we’re already seeing makes it clear—this is just the beginning. If you want to be part of the AI revolution and help us reinvent online grocery with cutting-edge tech, ping me! We’re hiring across all tech domains to lead this transformation.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

David PavlikDavid Pavlik,,"What a week with AI at Rohlik Tech Team! The speed at which we’re adopting and integrating AI tools is truly game-changing. A huge shoutout to Richard for leading the initiative:🚀 Code Development Assistants – We’ve equipped many engineers with Cursor and experimented with Windsurf, VS Cline, and Junie by IntelliJ. The impact?• 15% faster development in mobile domain• 50% acceleration in unit test co-generation🔍 Code Review Assistance – Big wins here with CodeRabbit, GitLab Duo, and a pilot with local-based Callstack.ai. Results so far:• 30% reduction in review time• Eliminating the need for an extra reviewer🎨 AI-Driven UI Prototyping – tested rapid prototyping new UIs using Builder.io, directly integrating with Figma.In addition to that we are automating QA and other domains (stay tuned!).On top of all that, I had a great dinner with Jakub, who showed me how they’re using Devin.ai to automate ticket-to-PR workflows. While 80% of results are still unusable, the mindset shift among engineers is the real game-changer and you can well use the 20% :).While these are still proof of concepts, the impact we’re already seeing makes it clear—this is just the beginning. If you want to be part of the AI revolution and help us reinvent online grocery with cutting-edge tech, ping me! We’re hiring across all tech domains to lead this transformation.

BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

A huge shoutout to Richard for leading the initiative:🚀 Code Development Assistants – We’ve equipped many engineers with Cursor and experimented with Windsurf, VS Cline, and Junie by IntelliJ. The impact?• 15% faster development in mobile domain• 50% acceleration in unit test co-generation🔍 Code Review Assistance – Big wins here with CodeRabbit, GitLab Duo, and a pilot with local-based Callstack.ai. Results so far:• 30% reduction in review time• Eliminating the need for an extra reviewer🎨 AI-Driven UI Prototyping – tested rapid prototyping new UIs using Builder.io, directly integrating with Figma.In addition to that we are automating QA and other domains (stay tuned!).On top of all that, I had a great dinner with Jakub, who showed me how they’re using Devin.ai to automate ticket-to-PR workflows. While 80% of results are still unusable, the mindset shift among engineers is the real game-changer and you can well use the 20% :).While these are still proof of concepts, the impact we’re already seeing makes it clear—this is just the beginning.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

David PavlikDavid Pavlik,,"What a week with AI at Rohlik Tech Team! The speed at which we’re adopting and integrating AI tools is truly game-changing. A huge shoutout to Richard for leading the initiative:🚀 Code Development Assistants – We’ve equipped many engineers with Cursor and experimented with Windsurf, VS Cline, and Junie by IntelliJ. The impact?• 15% faster development in mobile domain• 50% acceleration in unit test co-generation🔍 Code Review Assistance – Big wins here with CodeRabbit, GitLab Duo, and a pilot with local-based Callstack.ai. Results so far:• 30% reduction in review time• Eliminating the need for an extra reviewer🎨 AI-Driven UI Prototyping – tested rapid prototyping new UIs using Builder.io, directly integrating with Figma.In addition to that we are automating QA and other domains (stay tuned!).On top of all that, I had a great dinner with Jakub, who showed me how they’re using Devin.ai to automate ticket-to-PR workflows. While 80% of results are still unusable, the mindset shift among engineers is the real game-changer and you can well use the 20% :).While these are still proof of concepts, the impact we’re already seeing makes it clear—this is just the beginning. If you want to be part of the AI revolution and help us reinvent online grocery with cutting-edge tech, ping me! We’re hiring across all tech domains to lead this transformation.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.

David PavlikDavid Pavlik,,"What a week with AI at Rohlik Tech Team! The speed at which we’re adopting and integrating AI tools is truly game-changing. A huge shoutout to Richard for leading the initiative:🚀 Code Development Assistants – We’ve equipped many engineers with Cursor and experimented with Windsurf, VS Cline, and Junie by IntelliJ. The impact?• 15% faster development in mobile domain• 50% acceleration in unit test co-generation🔍 Code Review Assistance – Big wins here with CodeRabbit, GitLab Duo, and a pilot with local-based Callstack.ai. Results so far:• 30% reduction in review time• Eliminating the need for an extra reviewer🎨 AI-Driven UI Prototyping – tested rapid prototyping new UIs using Builder.io, directly integrating with Figma.In addition to that we are automating QA and other domains (stay tuned!).On top of all that, I had a great dinner with Jakub, who showed me how they’re using Devin.ai to automate ticket-to-PR workflows. While 80% of results are still unusable, the mindset shift among engineers is the real game-changer and you can well use the 20% :).While these are still proof of concepts, the impact we’re already seeing makes it clear—this is just the beginning. If you want to be part of the AI revolution and help us reinvent online grocery with cutting-edge tech, ping me! We’re hiring across all tech domains to lead this transformation.

Grace SumnerGrace Sumner,,"I keep having my comments removed but it's important to really bring home that Beyond the Streets, by default, conflate sex work and sexual exploitation. BtS see them as synonymous l(see comments for evidence) I thank Emily Vaughn for highlighting this, and repeatedly. Listen to SWers & not block or delete those voices that don't align with organisations.It's important when working with marginalised groups that they are able to access you and be supported to attend services. This includes beyond phone support in another city.Generally, why is the conflation considered dangerous?- Genuine victims of exploitation are seen as sex workers, which is inappropriate- Sex workers' autonomy and consent is decided for us and removed- Allows others (especially women) to speak over sex workers because they're seen as victims who are too traumatised and need someone to speak for ""the voiceless""- Consent - the biggest difference- Ignores the boundaries set by the sex worker themselves- Sex workers not believed when genuinely exploited because it's seen as all the same - IF WE BELIEVE WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEYRE RAPED, WE MUST BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT

Yitzhak SassonYitzhak Sasson,,"Making Aliyah with Kids: An Investment in Their FutureMoving to Israel with children can feel overwhelming. As parents, you might worry about jobs, finances, or adjusting to a new culture. But while there may be struggles along the way, making Aliyah is one of the best investments you can make for your children’s future.A Built-in Network for Success In Israel, connections (known as protektzia) play a huge role in finding jobs and opportunities. Children who grow up here naturally build friendships, attend school with future colleagues, and serve in the army or national service, forming bonds that last a lifetime. When it comes time to find a job, they’ll already know people in their field who can help them get a foot in the door.Affordable, High-Quality Education Unlike in the U.S., where university costs can be crushing, Israel offers world-class higher education at a fraction of the price. Many children of Olim attend university almost for free, thanks to government subsidies and scholarships. They can graduate without student debt, giving them a huge financial advantage.A Strong Social System Israel’s healthcare system is among the best in the world and is accessible to all residents. There are also generous benefits for young families, including tax breaks, free daycare options, and social programs that make life easier as they start their own families.While you as a parent may experience some challenges, your children will grow up fully integrated, fluent in Hebrew, and part of a society that values community and support. The struggles you face now are temporary, but the benefits for your children will last a lifetime.Aliyah is more than a move—it’s an investment in a brighter future for your family. And that’s worth everything.
