Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent.

Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad?

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume.

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Sandra Borrego RodriguezSandra Borrego Rodriguez,,"https://lnkd.in/dNgdGdHWLa realidad es que yo he trabajado en empresas que ofertan puestos en  LinkedIn, y sigo en varios procesos de selección actualmente, también ofertados aquí, y ahora aparecen 8453579 perfiles de páginas creadas para el tema del trabajo en remoto, y ni una tiene un puesto real. Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Sandra Borrego RodriguezSandra Borrego Rodriguez,,"https://lnkd.in/dNgdGdHWLa realidad es que yo he trabajado en empresas que ofertan puestos en  LinkedIn, y sigo en varios procesos de selección actualmente, también ofertados aquí, y ahora aparecen 8453579 perfiles de páginas creadas para el tema del trabajo en remoto, y ni una tiene un puesto real. Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent.

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise. However, systemic change is needed.

Sandra Borrego RodriguezSandra Borrego Rodriguez,,"https://lnkd.in/dNgdGdHWLa realidad es que yo he trabajado en empresas que ofertan puestos en  LinkedIn, y sigo en varios procesos de selección actualmente, también ofertados aquí, y ahora aparecen 8453579 perfiles de páginas creadas para el tema del trabajo en remoto, y ni una tiene un puesto real. Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume.

A career that’s been pre-packaged, mass-produced, and easily replaced.🍨 So before dessert, ask yourself: Are you the chef of your own career, or just another item on the menu?WARNING: This 𝐂𝐭𝐫𝐥.𝐀𝐥𝐭.𝐃𝐞𝐥 edition serves up the truth—spicy like hot wings, peri-peri flavoured, and unapologetically raw.Dig in. Digest it. Then decide if you’re ready to cook up your OWN something for humanity, better than goop recipes, brunch at tashas Cafe or hashtag#UberEats deliveries.

These early years are your golden ticket to embrace the uncomfortable and focus on pure, raw learning.📌 Getting caught up in office politics and groupism? Big no-no!

Sandra Borrego RodriguezSandra Borrego Rodriguez,,"https://lnkd.in/dNgdGdHWLa realidad es que yo he trabajado en empresas que ofertan puestos en  LinkedIn, y sigo en varios procesos de selección actualmente, también ofertados aquí, y ahora aparecen 8453579 perfiles de páginas creadas para el tema del trabajo en remoto, y ni una tiene un puesto real. Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent.

Sandra Borrego RodriguezSandra Borrego Rodriguez,,"https://lnkd.in/dNgdGdHWLa realidad es que yo he trabajado en empresas que ofertan puestos en  LinkedIn, y sigo en varios procesos de selección actualmente, también ofertados aquí, y ahora aparecen 8453579 perfiles de páginas creadas para el tema del trabajo en remoto, y ni una tiene un puesto real. Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Nirob HossenNirob Hossen,,"Microservice Roadmap Creating a roadmap for implementing microservices architecture involves several key phases and considerations.Microservice RoadmapPhase 1: Assessment and Planning1.Understand Business Goals:✅️Identify the business objectives that the microservices architecture will support.✅️Engage stakeholders to gather requirements and expectations.2.Evaluate Current Architecture:✅️Assess the existing system architecture.✅️Identify pain points and limitations of the monolithic system.3.Define Success Metrics:✅️Establish KPIs to measure the success of the microservices implementation.4.Skill Assessment:✅️Evaluate the current team’s skills in microservices, DevOps, and cloud technologies.✅️Identify training needs or hiring requirements.Phase 2: Design and Strategy5.Define Service Boundaries:✅️Identify logical boundaries for microservices based on business capabilities.✅️Use domain-driven design (DDD) principles to guide service decomposition.6.Select Technology Stack:✅️Choose appropriate languages, frameworks, and tools for developing microservices.✅️Consider containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and cloud platforms.7.Design APIs:✅️Define API contracts (REST, gRPC, GraphQL) for communication between services.✅️Ensure APIs are versioned and follow best practices.8.Establish Data Management Strategy:✅️Decide on data ownership for each service.✅️Choose between shared databases and database per service patterns.Phase 3: Development and Implementation9.Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:✅️Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automating builds and deployments.10.Develop Microservices:✅️Start building microservices iteratively, focusing on high-priority services first.✅️Follow best practices for coding, testing, and documentation.11.Implement Service Discovery:✅️Choose a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Eureka, Consul) to facilitate communication between services.12.Establish Monitoring and Logging:✅️Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for observability.Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance13.Automated Testing:✅️Develop unit, integration, and contract tests for microservices.✅️Implement service virtualization for testing inter-service interactions.14.Load and Performance Testing:✅️Conduct load testing to ensure services can handle expected traffic.15.Security Assessment:✅️Implement security best practices, including API security (OAuth2, JWT) and service-to-service authentication.💡Ultimately, successful microservices implementation is not just about technology but also about aligning with business goals, fostering a collaborative culture, and continuously improving processes.Want to know more?

AtarjamatAtarjamat,,"Securing the Future of the UK Food Industry: The Strategic Role of ApprenticeshipsWith the UK food and beverage sector employing over half a million people and contributing £38 billion to the economy annually, the industry’s success depends on a skilled, future-ready workforce. Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise. However, systemic change is needed. The proposed Growth and Skills Levy could play a pivotal role in reforming workforce development, ensuring apprenticeships remain a strategic asset for the sector.How can businesses and policymakers collaborate to enhance the impact of apprenticeships?

Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad?

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent.

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent.

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Sandra Borrego RodriguezSandra Borrego Rodriguez,,"https://lnkd.in/dNgdGdHWLa realidad es que yo he trabajado en empresas que ofertan puestos en  LinkedIn, y sigo en varios procesos de selección actualmente, también ofertados aquí, y ahora aparecen 8453579 perfiles de páginas creadas para el tema del trabajo en remoto, y ni una tiene un puesto real. Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume.

A career that’s been pre-packaged, mass-produced, and easily replaced.🍨 So before dessert, ask yourself: Are you the chef of your own career, or just another item on the menu?WARNING: This 𝐂𝐭𝐫𝐥.𝐀𝐥𝐭.𝐃𝐞𝐥 edition serves up the truth—spicy like hot wings, peri-peri flavoured, and unapologetically raw.Dig in. Digest it. Then decide if you’re ready to cook up your OWN something for humanity, better than goop recipes, brunch at tashas Cafe or hashtag#UberEats deliveries.  Or simply step into the position you were meant to own.📌https://lnkd.in/d2qmUTuKhashtag#SundayChill hashtag#SundayLunch hashtag#SundayReadinghashtag#SundayPrimeTime hashtag#TransformativeCareers hashtag#ProfessionalPurpose hashtag#Future hashtag#Futurism hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#Creative hashtag#Leaders hashtag#Careers

Nirob HossenNirob Hossen,,"Microservice Roadmap Creating a roadmap for implementing microservices architecture involves several key phases and considerations.Microservice RoadmapPhase 1: Assessment and Planning1.Understand Business Goals:✅️Identify the business objectives that the microservices architecture will support.✅️Engage stakeholders to gather requirements and expectations.2.Evaluate Current Architecture:✅️Assess the existing system architecture.✅️Identify pain points and limitations of the monolithic system.3.Define Success Metrics:✅️Establish KPIs to measure the success of the microservices implementation.4.Skill Assessment:✅️Evaluate the current team’s skills in microservices, DevOps, and cloud technologies.✅️Identify training needs or hiring requirements.Phase 2: Design and Strategy5.Define Service Boundaries:✅️Identify logical boundaries for microservices based on business capabilities.✅️Use domain-driven design (DDD) principles to guide service decomposition.6.Select Technology Stack:✅️Choose appropriate languages, frameworks, and tools for developing microservices.✅️Consider containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), and cloud platforms.7.Design APIs:✅️Define API contracts (REST, gRPC, GraphQL) for communication between services.✅️Ensure APIs are versioned and follow best practices.8.Establish Data Management Strategy:✅️Decide on data ownership for each service.✅️Choose between shared databases and database per service patterns.Phase 3: Development and Implementation9.Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:✅️Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automating builds and deployments.10.Develop Microservices:✅️Start building microservices iteratively, focusing on high-priority services first.✅️Follow best practices for coding, testing, and documentation.11.Implement Service Discovery:✅️Choose a service discovery mechanism (e.g., Eureka, Consul) to facilitate communication between services.12.Establish Monitoring and Logging:✅️Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK Stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for observability.Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance13.Automated Testing:✅️Develop unit, integration, and contract tests for microservices.✅️Implement service virtualization for testing inter-service interactions.14.Load and Performance Testing:✅️Conduct load testing to ensure services can handle expected traffic.15.Security Assessment:✅️Implement security best practices, including API security (OAuth2, JWT) and service-to-service authentication.💡Ultimately, successful microservices implementation is not just about technology but also about aligning with business goals, fostering a collaborative culture, and continuously improving processes.Want to know more?

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos.

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise.

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Sandra Borrego RodriguezSandra Borrego Rodriguez,,"https://lnkd.in/dNgdGdHWLa realidad es que yo he trabajado en empresas que ofertan puestos en  LinkedIn, y sigo en varios procesos de selección actualmente, también ofertados aquí, y ahora aparecen 8453579 perfiles de páginas creadas para el tema del trabajo en remoto, y ni una tiene un puesto real. Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume.

AtarjamatAtarjamat,,"Securing the Future of the UK Food Industry: The Strategic Role of ApprenticeshipsWith the UK food and beverage sector employing over half a million people and contributing £38 billion to the economy annually, the industry’s success depends on a skilled, future-ready workforce. Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent. Companies like Fera Science and Tesco are investing in structured training programs that equip the next generation with hands-on experience and industry-specific expertise. However, systemic change is needed. The proposed Growth and Skills Levy could play a pivotal role in reforming workforce development, ensuring apprenticeships remain a strategic asset for the sector.How can businesses and policymakers collaborate to enhance the impact of apprenticeships?

Sandra Borrego RodriguezSandra Borrego Rodriguez,,"https://lnkd.in/dNgdGdHWLa realidad es que yo he trabajado en empresas que ofertan puestos en  LinkedIn, y sigo en varios procesos de selección actualmente, también ofertados aquí, y ahora aparecen 8453579 perfiles de páginas creadas para el tema del trabajo en remoto, y ni una tiene un puesto real. Me parece que se juega con la necesidad y vulnerabilidad de la gente, sólo porque se ha puesto de moda el trabajo en remoto. Dejad de engañar a la maldita gente ya. Y, si no, que se vean esas ofertas. Que me hincho a rellenar mi perfil 4 mil veces en estos lugares web y luego no recibo ni una sola propuesta y, lo que es peor, ni una en condiciones ofrecida en ninguno de estos portales, por favor! Muchos incluso están vacíos, igual se busca robar nuestros datos para venderlos. Que yo aquí he aplicado a Volkswagen, Seur, Amazon, Loewe, es decir, a empresas reales, donde he estado pasando proceso de selección. ¿Cómo podéis decir que se pierde el tiempo cuando son procesos de verdad? Me parece de una carencia de ética absoluta, ojalá se os penalizara por eso. Y encima eso de ""sin necesidad de hablar inglés"". Jajaja, es alucinante...

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!

Yet, a national shortage of food scientists and technologists threatens long-term sustainability.Apprenticeships are emerging as a powerful solution—bridging the skills gap, fostering innovation, and providing businesses with a pipeline of specialized talent.

Poorvi MalviyaPoorvi Malviya,,"🚨 Job Offer or Scam? Beware of This Email Tactic!🚨 I recently received an email from Jennifer Brown offering me an internship or entry-level job opportunity. It seemed legitimate at first—they asked for my resume, reviewed it, and then rejected me. But what followed exposed the real motive behind this scheme!🔹 Jennifer emailed me again, saying, ""Your resume was rejected due to a low ATS score, but I can connect you with someone who can improve it.""🔹 When I agreed, she directed me to a Fiverr profile where I could ""fix"" my resume—for a price!🔹 This wasn’t the first time! A few weeks ago, I received a similar email from another person. I even reached out to their Fiverr contact, only to realize they were just selling paid resume reviews for $5–$10.This time, before I could fall for it again, I came across a LinkedIn post by Sarthak Mittal (CEO) exposing this scam (even the screenshot uploaded by Sarthak Mittal and the email I received have the same content written). That’s when it all clicked!⚠ Red Flags to Watch For:🚨 A rejection email followed by a paid service pitch.🚨 Being told your ATS score is too low and offered ""help"" for a fee.🚨 Recruiters redirecting you to Fiverr or paid platforms.🚨 Different names but the same tactics and email formats.💡 Lesson Learned? Never pay for job applications or resume fixes unless you’ve done your own research! There are plenty of free AI tools to improve your resume. Don’t let scammers profit off your job search struggles.Have you received similar emails? Let’s spread awareness and expose these scams together!
