Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"üö® Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! üö®Lately, I‚Äôve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn‚Äîjob posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! üòëMany posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.üìå A humble request to recruiters and job posters: üëâ Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. üëâ Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. üëâ Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!üîç Job seekers, always verify before applying!
