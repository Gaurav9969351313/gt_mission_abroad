Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue? Share your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#Zuaitech hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#QATesting hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#StopSharingClosedJobs

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

Ashwani KumarAshwani Kumar,,"🚨 Stop Sharing Closed Job Posts! 🚨Lately, I’ve noticed a recurring pattern on LinkedIn—job posts getting the most views, yet they are already closed! 😑Many posts claim to be hashtag#Urgent_Hiring for roles like QA Engineer (Remote) with links to apply, but when candidates check, they realize the application was closed weeks ago! This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue? Share your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#Zuaitech hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#QATesting hashtag#ManualTesting hashtag#LinkedInCommunity hashtag#StopSharingClosedJobs

This not only wastes time but also creates false hope for job seekers actively looking for opportunities.📌 A humble request to recruiters and job posters: 👉 Please remove or update job posts once the position is filled. 👉 Avoid reposting old listings just for engagement. 👉 Transparency helps job seekers find real opportunities!🔍 Job seekers, always verify before applying! If you come across outdated posts, call them out or report them. Let’s keep LinkedIn a valuable platform for genuine job opportunities.Have you experienced this issue?
