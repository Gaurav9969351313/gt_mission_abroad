Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Ironically, the company still made them work out their notice period. 😅The best way to avoid this? Start performance management during hiring.🏆 Define success early - What should they achieve in the first 3-6 months?🏋 Be upfront about challenges - Every team has them🎭 Don’t oversell - The right hire beats a fast hireGreat hiring is about setting people up for success from day one.hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#PerformanceManagement hashtag#Interviewing

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Goutam Kumar GiriGoutam Kumar Giri,,"🌟hashtag#Java Coding Standards: Write Clean, Maintainable Code! 🚀 Adopting consistent coding standards is key to team productivity and reducing bugs. Here’s a quick guide to Java statement best practices for readability and reliability! 💡✅ Simple & Compound Statements1️⃣ One Statement Per Lineargv++; // Good: One statement on this lineargc--; // Good: Another statement on a separate lineargv++; argc--; // Avoid: two statements on one line can obscure what’s happening.Readability: When each statement is on a separate line, it's easier for someone reading the code to quickly understand what each part does.Maintainability: Debugging and modifying code becomes simpler because you can pinpoint exactly which statement might be causing an issue.Version Control: Changes to individual statements are easier to track in tools like Git, as each change is isolated to a single line.2️⃣ Always Use Braces (even for single-line if/for):if (condition) { doSomething();  // Avoid ""if (cond) doSomething();""}🔀 Control Flow Statementsif-else:if (score > 90) { grade = 'A';} else if (score > 80) { grade = 'B';} else { grade = 'C';}Loops (for, while, do-while):for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i);}while (isRunning) { pollServer();}🎚️ switch StatementsAlways include a default case.Comment fall-throughs:switch (status) { case ACTIVE: enableUser(); /* falls through */  // Explicit comment! case PENDING: logActivity(); break; default: throw new InvalidStatusException();}🛡️ Error Handlingtry-catch-finally:try { processFile();} catch (IOException e) { logger.error(""File error"", e);} finally { cleanupResources();}🔙 return StatementsAvoid unnecessary parentheses:return result;return (x > 0 ? x : 0);  // Parentheses add clarity here💡 Pro TipsAvoid Magic Numbers: Use constants instead of raw values.Limit Loop Complexity: Break down nested loops into methods.Use Linters: Tools like Checkstyle or SonarLint automate standard enforcement!💬 Let’s Discuss!What coding standards does your team enforce?👉 Tag a developer who champions clean code!hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingStandards hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#TechTips hashtag#Programming hashtag#SDET

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Leon B (Bezuidenhout)Leon B (Bezuidenhout),,"Performance management starts in the interviewMisaligned expectations in hiring are an expensive mistake. The time spent finding, onboarding, and eventually offboarding someone, only to restart the cycle...I worked at a company where a new hire resigned on day one because they didn’t realise we were a Java house, and they were looking for a .NET role. Ironically, the company still made them work out their notice period. 😅The best way to avoid this? Start performance management during hiring.🏆 Define success early - What should they achieve in the first 3-6 months?🏋 Be upfront about challenges - Every team has them🎭 Don’t oversell - The right hire beats a fast hireGreat hiring is about setting people up for success from day one.hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#PerformanceManagement hashtag#Interviewing

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Goutam Kumar GiriGoutam Kumar Giri,,"🌟hashtag#Java Coding Standards: Write Clean, Maintainable Code! 🚀 Adopting consistent coding standards is key to team productivity and reducing bugs. Here’s a quick guide to Java statement best practices for readability and reliability! 💡✅ Simple & Compound Statements1️⃣ One Statement Per Lineargv++; // Good: One statement on this lineargc--; // Good: Another statement on a separate lineargv++; argc--; // Avoid: two statements on one line can obscure what’s happening.Readability: When each statement is on a separate line, it's easier for someone reading the code to quickly understand what each part does.Maintainability: Debugging and modifying code becomes simpler because you can pinpoint exactly which statement might be causing an issue.Version Control: Changes to individual statements are easier to track in tools like Git, as each change is isolated to a single line.2️⃣ Always Use Braces (even for single-line if/for):if (condition) { doSomething();  // Avoid ""if (cond) doSomething();""}🔀 Control Flow Statementsif-else:if (score > 90) { grade = 'A';} else if (score > 80) { grade = 'B';} else { grade = 'C';}Loops (for, while, do-while):for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i);}while (isRunning) { pollServer();}🎚️ switch StatementsAlways include a default case.Comment fall-throughs:switch (status) { case ACTIVE: enableUser(); /* falls through */  // Explicit comment! case PENDING: logActivity(); break; default: throw new InvalidStatusException();}🛡️ Error Handlingtry-catch-finally:try { processFile();} catch (IOException e) { logger.error(""File error"", e);} finally { cleanupResources();}🔙 return StatementsAvoid unnecessary parentheses:return result;return (x > 0 ? x : 0);  // Parentheses add clarity here💡 Pro TipsAvoid Magic Numbers: Use constants instead of raw values.Limit Loop Complexity: Break down nested loops into methods.Use Linters: Tools like Checkstyle or SonarLint automate standard enforcement!💬 Let’s Discuss!What coding standards does your team enforce?👉 Tag a developer who champions clean code!hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingStandards hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#TechTips hashtag#Programming hashtag#SDET

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Goutam Kumar GiriGoutam Kumar Giri,,"🌟hashtag#Java Coding Standards: Write Clean, Maintainable Code! 🚀 Adopting consistent coding standards is key to team productivity and reducing bugs. Here’s a quick guide to Java statement best practices for readability and reliability! 💡✅ Simple & Compound Statements1️⃣ One Statement Per Lineargv++; // Good: One statement on this lineargc--; // Good: Another statement on a separate lineargv++; argc--; // Avoid: two statements on one line can obscure what’s happening.Readability: When each statement is on a separate line, it's easier for someone reading the code to quickly understand what each part does.Maintainability: Debugging and modifying code becomes simpler because you can pinpoint exactly which statement might be causing an issue.Version Control: Changes to individual statements are easier to track in tools like Git, as each change is isolated to a single line.2️⃣ Always Use Braces (even for single-line if/for):if (condition) { doSomething();  // Avoid ""if (cond) doSomething();""}🔀 Control Flow Statementsif-else:if (score > 90) { grade = 'A';} else if (score > 80) { grade = 'B';} else { grade = 'C';}Loops (for, while, do-while):for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i);}while (isRunning) { pollServer();}🎚️ switch StatementsAlways include a default case.Comment fall-throughs:switch (status) { case ACTIVE: enableUser(); /* falls through */  // Explicit comment! case PENDING: logActivity(); break; default: throw new InvalidStatusException();}🛡️ Error Handlingtry-catch-finally:try { processFile();} catch (IOException e) { logger.error(""File error"", e);} finally { cleanupResources();}🔙 return StatementsAvoid unnecessary parentheses:return result;return (x > 0 ? x : 0);  // Parentheses add clarity here💡 Pro TipsAvoid Magic Numbers: Use constants instead of raw values.Limit Loop Complexity: Break down nested loops into methods.Use Linters: Tools like Checkstyle or SonarLint automate standard enforcement!💬 Let’s Discuss!What coding standards does your team enforce?👉 Tag a developer who champions clean code!hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingStandards hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#TechTips hashtag#Programming hashtag#SDET

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Goutam Kumar GiriGoutam Kumar Giri,,"🌟hashtag#Java Coding Standards: Write Clean, Maintainable Code! 🚀 Adopting consistent coding standards is key to team productivity and reducing bugs. Here’s a quick guide to Java statement best practices for readability and reliability! 💡✅ Simple & Compound Statements1️⃣ One Statement Per Lineargv++; // Good: One statement on this lineargc--; // Good: Another statement on a separate lineargv++; argc--; // Avoid: two statements on one line can obscure what’s happening.Readability: When each statement is on a separate line, it's easier for someone reading the code to quickly understand what each part does.Maintainability: Debugging and modifying code becomes simpler because you can pinpoint exactly which statement might be causing an issue.Version Control: Changes to individual statements are easier to track in tools like Git, as each change is isolated to a single line.2️⃣ Always Use Braces (even for single-line if/for):if (condition) { doSomething();  // Avoid ""if (cond) doSomething();""}🔀 Control Flow Statementsif-else:if (score > 90) { grade = 'A';} else if (score > 80) { grade = 'B';} else { grade = 'C';}Loops (for, while, do-while):for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i);}while (isRunning) { pollServer();}🎚️ switch StatementsAlways include a default case.Comment fall-throughs:switch (status) { case ACTIVE: enableUser(); /* falls through */  // Explicit comment! case PENDING: logActivity(); break; default: throw new InvalidStatusException();}🛡️ Error Handlingtry-catch-finally:try { processFile();} catch (IOException e) { logger.error(""File error"", e);} finally { cleanupResources();}🔙 return StatementsAvoid unnecessary parentheses:return result;return (x > 0 ? x : 0);  // Parentheses add clarity here💡 Pro TipsAvoid Magic Numbers: Use constants instead of raw values.Limit Loop Complexity: Break down nested loops into methods.Use Linters: Tools like Checkstyle or SonarLint automate standard enforcement!💬 Let’s Discuss!What coding standards does your team enforce?👉 Tag a developer who champions clean code!hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingStandards hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#TechTips hashtag#Programming hashtag#SDET

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Leon B (Bezuidenhout)Leon B (Bezuidenhout),,"Performance management starts in the interviewMisaligned expectations in hiring are an expensive mistake. The time spent finding, onboarding, and eventually offboarding someone, only to restart the cycle...I worked at a company where a new hire resigned on day one because they didn’t realise we were a Java house, and they were looking for a .NET role. Ironically, the company still made them work out their notice period. 😅The best way to avoid this? Start performance management during hiring.🏆 Define success early - What should they achieve in the first 3-6 months?🏋 Be upfront about challenges - Every team has them🎭 Don’t oversell - The right hire beats a fast hireGreat hiring is about setting people up for success from day one.hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#PerformanceManagement hashtag#Interviewing

Here’s a quick guide to Java statement best practices for readability and reliability! 💡✅ Simple & Compound Statements1️⃣ One Statement Per Lineargv++; // Good: One statement on this lineargc--; // Good: Another statement on a separate lineargv++; argc--; // Avoid: two statements on one line can obscure what’s happening.Readability: When each statement is on a separate line, it's easier for someone reading the code to quickly understand what each part does.Maintainability: Debugging and modifying code becomes simpler because you can pinpoint exactly which statement might be causing an issue.Version Control: Changes to individual statements are easier to track in tools like Git, as each change is isolated to a single line.2️⃣ Always Use Braces (even for single-line if/for):if (condition) { doSomething();  // Avoid ""if (cond) doSomething();""}🔀 Control Flow Statementsif-else:if (score > 90) { grade = 'A';} else if (score > 80) { grade = 'B';} else { grade = 'C';}Loops (for, while, do-while):for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i);}while (isRunning) { pollServer();}🎚️ switch StatementsAlways include a default case.Comment fall-throughs:switch (status) { case ACTIVE: enableUser(); /* falls through */  // Explicit comment! case PENDING: logActivity(); break; default: throw new InvalidStatusException();}🛡️ Error Handlingtry-catch-finally:try { processFile();} catch (IOException e) { logger.error(""File error"", e);} finally { cleanupResources();}🔙 return StatementsAvoid unnecessary parentheses:return result;return (x > 0 ? x : 0);  // Parentheses add clarity here💡 Pro TipsAvoid Magic Numbers: Use constants instead of raw values.Limit Loop Complexity: Break down nested loops into methods.Use Linters: Tools like Checkstyle or SonarLint automate standard enforcement!💬 Let’s Discuss!What coding standards does your team enforce?👉 Tag a developer who champions clean code!hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingStandards hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#TechTips hashtag#Programming hashtag#SDET

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Here’s a quick guide to Java statement best practices for readability and reliability! 💡✅ Simple & Compound Statements1️⃣ One Statement Per Lineargv++; // Good: One statement on this lineargc--; // Good: Another statement on a separate lineargv++; argc--; // Avoid: two statements on one line can obscure what’s happening.Readability: When each statement is on a separate line, it's easier for someone reading the code to quickly understand what each part does.Maintainability: Debugging and modifying code becomes simpler because you can pinpoint exactly which statement might be causing an issue.Version Control: Changes to individual statements are easier to track in tools like Git, as each change is isolated to a single line.2️⃣ Always Use Braces (even for single-line if/for):if (condition) { doSomething();  // Avoid ""if (cond) doSomething();""}🔀 Control Flow Statementsif-else:if (score > 90) { grade = 'A';} else if (score > 80) { grade = 'B';} else { grade = 'C';}Loops (for, while, do-while):for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i);}while (isRunning) { pollServer();}🎚️ switch StatementsAlways include a default case.Comment fall-throughs:switch (status) { case ACTIVE: enableUser(); /* falls through */  // Explicit comment! case PENDING: logActivity(); break; default: throw new InvalidStatusException();}🛡️ Error Handlingtry-catch-finally:try { processFile();} catch (IOException e) { logger.error(""File error"", e);} finally { cleanupResources();}🔙 return StatementsAvoid unnecessary parentheses:return result;return (x > 0 ? x : 0);  // Parentheses add clarity here💡 Pro TipsAvoid Magic Numbers: Use constants instead of raw values.Limit Loop Complexity: Break down nested loops into methods.Use Linters: Tools like Checkstyle or SonarLint automate standard enforcement!💬 Let’s Discuss!What coding standards does your team enforce?👉 Tag a developer who champions clean code!hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingStandards hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#TechTips hashtag#Programming hashtag#SDET

Tamir ShklazTamir Shklaz,,"I’m joining Wordware (YC S24)'s founding team.when I learned to code, it wasn’t just a skill—it was a tool for creation. suddenly, an idea wasn’t just a thought, it was something I could bring into the world.it’s how I launched three startups, how I made a living, and how I found a way to express myself. I didn’t just write code; I built companies, products, and systems that people used. it was the closest thing to magic I’d ever experienced.for the last 3 years, I’ve been teaching kids to code, and I saw firsthand what it meant to go from consumer to creator. I watched students light up when they built their first game, realizing they could shape the world instead of just interacting with it. for some students it was the first time they saw themselves as builders.but coding is hard. I watched kids struggle—not with the logic or the ideas, but with the translation. they knew what they wanted to build, but getting a computer to understand them was a whole other challenge.learning to code isn’t just about problem-solving—it’s about learning how to translate your ideas into something a computer understands. and that translation is brutal. debugging obscure errors, memorizing syntax, getting stuck on a missing semicolon.I watched kids lose momentum, not because they lacked creativity or drive, but because the tools got in their way.but everyone already knows english.what if instead of learning python or java script, you could just describe what you want in plain english, and it would work?then, a few months ago, I was demoing wordware when I saw something that stuck with me. someone with zero coding experience built an ai system that automated their entire hiring process—filtering resumes, scheduling interviews, even generating follow-ups—all without writing a single line of code.and I saw that same look I used to see in kids' eyes when, after three months of struggling with syntax, coding finally clicked. except this time, it clicked instantly.that’s when I knew.wordware is doing for ai what I had spent years trying to do for coding—giving more people the power to create.software used to be built by engineers. with wordware, it’s built by anyone who can think clearly, and create with intent.ai isn’t just about automation—it’s about taste. the best products aren’t just functional, they carry the imprint of their creators. the decisions they make, the way they think, the experiences they shape.until now, you needed an engineering team to translate your vision into software. with wordware, you don’t. you can imbue your taste directly into what you build.and this goes beyond startups—1 billion+ knowledge workers should be able to build ai that works the way they think. not generic chatbots, but ai that carries their judgment, workflows, and expertise and amplifies their ability to create.this is the future we’re building; if this resonates with you, we’re hiring engineers, designers and more—link in the comments.

Dr. Namranil MukherjeeDr. Namranil Mukherjee,,"Discipline Over Talent | A Leader’s PerspectiveOne of the biggest dilemmas in hiring is whether to prioritize hashtag#talent or hashtag#discipline. Many organizations follow a standard selection process—resume shortlisting based on qualifications, years of experience, and keyword matches, followed by multiple technical rounds, salary negotiation, and onboarding.However, this process often overlooks three fundamental aspects:1️⃣ hashtag#Cultural Fit & hashtag#Leadership Qualities – We rarely assess a candidate’s values, leadership potential, emotional intelligence, and long-term career aspirations. Without these, even the most technically skilled professional may struggle to align with the organization’s vision.2️⃣ hashtag#Fairness in CTC Negotiation – Too often, offers are made based on the candidate’s current situation rather than their market worth. Negotiating aggressively based on a candidate’s limitations can lead to disengagement and early attrition. A motivated workforce thrives on fair pay and respect, not just job security.3️⃣ hashtag#Experience Beyond Years – Experience isn't just about time served; it’s about the depth of exposure—handling complex projects, stakeholder management, revenue impact, team leadership, and adaptability. A true measure of experience goes beyond the number of years in a role.In my leadership experience, redefining the hiring SOP with these principles led to a significant improvement in project delivery, hashtag#revenue generation, and employee hashtag#retention.The Real Differentiator? hashtag#Disciplined hashtag#Talent.Talent alone is valuable, but disciplined talent is a game-changer. Even if someone has slightly less technical expertise, discipline ensures continuous hashtag#learning, hashtag#quality output, hashtag#teamwork, and a strong work hashtag#ethic. It shapes the culture of an organization and sustains long-term hashtag#success.It’s time we rethink our hiring processes—prioritizing hashtag#emotional hashtag#intelligence, cultural alignment, and fairness over just technical strength and years of experience.What’s your take? Have you seen the impact of discipline over talent in your organization? Let’s discuss.

Goutam Kumar GiriGoutam Kumar Giri,,"🌟hashtag#Java Coding Standards: Write Clean, Maintainable Code! 🚀 Adopting consistent coding standards is key to team productivity and reducing bugs. Here’s a quick guide to Java statement best practices for readability and reliability! 💡✅ Simple & Compound Statements1️⃣ One Statement Per Lineargv++; // Good: One statement on this lineargc--; // Good: Another statement on a separate lineargv++; argc--; // Avoid: two statements on one line can obscure what’s happening.Readability: When each statement is on a separate line, it's easier for someone reading the code to quickly understand what each part does.Maintainability: Debugging and modifying code becomes simpler because you can pinpoint exactly which statement might be causing an issue.Version Control: Changes to individual statements are easier to track in tools like Git, as each change is isolated to a single line.2️⃣ Always Use Braces (even for single-line if/for):if (condition) { doSomething();  // Avoid ""if (cond) doSomething();""}🔀 Control Flow Statementsif-else:if (score > 90) { grade = 'A';} else if (score > 80) { grade = 'B';} else { grade = 'C';}Loops (for, while, do-while):for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println(i);}while (isRunning) { pollServer();}🎚️ switch StatementsAlways include a default case.Comment fall-throughs:switch (status) { case ACTIVE: enableUser(); /* falls through */  // Explicit comment! case PENDING: logActivity(); break; default: throw new InvalidStatusException();}🛡️ Error Handlingtry-catch-finally:try { processFile();} catch (IOException e) { logger.error(""File error"", e);} finally { cleanupResources();}🔙 return StatementsAvoid unnecessary parentheses:return result;return (x > 0 ? x : 0);  // Parentheses add clarity here💡 Pro TipsAvoid Magic Numbers: Use constants instead of raw values.Limit Loop Complexity: Break down nested loops into methods.Use Linters: Tools like Checkstyle or SonarLint automate standard enforcement!💬 Let’s Discuss!What coding standards does your team enforce?👉 Tag a developer who champions clean code!hashtag#Java hashtag#CodingStandards hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#TechTips hashtag#Programming hashtag#SDET
