Martin ConnellMartin Connell,,"Is Platform Engineering changing the landscape of DevOps hiring?DevOps has clearly been the backbone of modern software delivery for many years now..But recently, I've been taking job briefings from multiple hiring managers and a lot of them are evolving from traditional DevOps towards Platform Engineering. Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Martin ConnellMartin Connell,,"Is Platform Engineering changing the landscape of DevOps hiring?DevOps has clearly been the backbone of modern software delivery for many years now..But recently, I've been taking job briefings from multiple hiring managers and a lot of them are evolving from traditional DevOps towards Platform Engineering. Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Martin ConnellMartin Connell,,"Is Platform Engineering changing the landscape of DevOps hiring?DevOps has clearly been the backbone of modern software delivery for many years now..But recently, I've been taking job briefings from multiple hiring managers and a lot of them are evolving from traditional DevOps towards Platform Engineering. Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Martin ConnellMartin Connell,,"Is Platform Engineering changing the landscape of DevOps hiring?DevOps has clearly been the backbone of modern software delivery for many years now..But recently, I've been taking job briefings from multiple hiring managers and a lot of them are evolving from traditional DevOps towards Platform Engineering. Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Martin ConnellMartin Connell,,"Is Platform Engineering changing the landscape of DevOps hiring?DevOps has clearly been the backbone of modern software delivery for many years now..But recently, I've been taking job briefings from multiple hiring managers and a lot of them are evolving from traditional DevOps towards Platform Engineering. Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Martin ConnellMartin Connell,,"Is Platform Engineering changing the landscape of DevOps hiring?DevOps has clearly been the backbone of modern software delivery for many years now..But recently, I've been taking job briefings from multiple hiring managers and a lot of them are evolving from traditional DevOps towards Platform Engineering. Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Martin ConnellMartin Connell,,"Is Platform Engineering changing the landscape of DevOps hiring?DevOps has clearly been the backbone of modern software delivery for many years now..But recently, I've been taking job briefings from multiple hiring managers and a lot of them are evolving from traditional DevOps towards Platform Engineering. Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Martin ConnellMartin Connell,,"Is Platform Engineering changing the landscape of DevOps hiring?DevOps has clearly been the backbone of modern software delivery for many years now..But recently, I've been taking job briefings from multiple hiring managers and a lot of them are evolving from traditional DevOps towards Platform Engineering. Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!

Reasons for taking this approach:✅ More focus on platform engineers who can design scalable, self-service infrastructure. ✅ Stronger emphasis on developer experience. Engineering teams need platforms that reduce cognitive load. ✅ Less manual DevOps work, more automation-first mindsets.If you're a DevOps, Cloud, or SRE professional, upskilling in platform engineering concepts could be a game-changer for your career 📈Can you see any other advantages (or disadvantages) of taking this approach?hashtag#Cloud hashtag#DevOps hashtag#PlatformEngineering hashtag#SRE

Izzedeen AlfarraIzzedeen Alfarra,,"understand CI/CD As a Story Imagine you are a baker who owns a bakery. You create delicious cakes (your software). Every time you make a new cake, you want to ensure:1. The recipe is followed correctly (code is correct).2. The cake tastes good (no bugs or errors).3. The cake is delivered fresh to customers quickly (new features reach users fast).Now, let’s introduce CI/CD to make this process smooth!Step 1: Continuous Integration (CI) – Mixing the Ingredients RightYou and your team are working together, adding new flavors to your cakes (writing new code). But before selling, you must ensure everything blends well.With CI, every time a baker (developer) adds a new ingredient (new code), an automated system:✔ Checks if the recipe is correct (tests the code).✔ Ensures the cake isn't ruined (prevents breaking the software).If something is wrong, you fix it immediately before baking more cakes.Step 2: Continuous Delivery (CD) – Keeping the Cake ReadyOnce your cake passes all the tests, you prepare it for delivery.With CD, the bakery automatically boxes the cake (packages the code) and places it in the delivery van (ready for deployment).But you still need to press a button to send it to customers.Step 3: Continuous Deployment (CD) – Auto-Delivering CakesImagine a robot delivery service that automatically delivers cakes to customers as soon as they are ready—without you pressing a button.This is Continuous Deployment, where every approved update goes live instantly.Why CI/CD is Amazing?✅ No bad cakes – Code is always tested.✅ Faster delivery – Users get updates quickly.✅ Less work – Automation handles testing & deployment.Real-Life ExampleThink of apps like Facebook, YouTube, or Instagram. They release updates frequently without users noticing downtime—thanks to CI/CD!
