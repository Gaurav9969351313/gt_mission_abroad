Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy.

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy.

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy.

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy.

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy.

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

This is where the technique of Vibrocompaction comes in—an advanced, efficient method used to densify loose or soft soils, creating a stronger, more stable foundation for structures to rise.Vibrocompaction is a geotechnical technique where a vibrating probe (known as a vibroflot) is inserted into the ground. The probe vibrates at high frequencies, rearranging granular soil particles (in this case, sea bed dredged sand) into a denser arrangement.🏝️ Damac - Amali Islands: A Vision of Luxury and ExclusivityIn the heart of The World Islands, Amali Islands is set to deliver 24+ exotic private beach villas, each offering breathtaking views of the Dubai skyline and crystal-clear waters.hashtag#Vibrocompaction hashtag#GeotechnicalEngineering hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#AmaliIslands hashtag#LuxuryLiving hashtag#TheWorldIslands hashtag#SustainableDevelopment hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#ConstructionTech hashtag#EngineeringMarvel hashtag#Villas hashtag#BeachfrontLiving hashtag#Dubai

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy.

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

This is where the technique of Vibrocompaction comes in—an advanced, efficient method used to densify loose or soft soils, creating a stronger, more stable foundation for structures to rise.Vibrocompaction is a geotechnical technique where a vibrating probe (known as a vibroflot) is inserted into the ground. The probe vibrates at high frequencies, rearranging granular soil particles (in this case, sea bed dredged sand) into a denser arrangement.🏝️ Damac - Amali Islands: A Vision of Luxury and ExclusivityIn the heart of The World Islands, Amali Islands is set to deliver 24+ exotic private beach villas, each offering breathtaking views of the Dubai skyline and crystal-clear waters.hashtag#Vibrocompaction hashtag#GeotechnicalEngineering hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#AmaliIslands hashtag#LuxuryLiving hashtag#TheWorldIslands hashtag#SustainableDevelopment hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#ConstructionTech hashtag#EngineeringMarvel hashtag#Villas hashtag#BeachfrontLiving hashtag#Dubai

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Nasra Saeed Al MamariNasra Saeed Al Mamari,,"📉 Dubai Rents: Signs of a Slowdown? 📉Dubai’s rental market has been on a steep climb for the past two years, but recent data suggests that rent increases are finally losing momentum.While demand remains strong in prime areas like Dubai Marina, Downtown Dubai, and Palm Jumeirah, the pace of rental hikes is slowing in locations with increasing supply, such as Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC), Arjan, Dubailand, and Dubai South.🔹 Key Insights:✅ Rental growth is moderating in JVC, Arjan, Dubailand, and Dubai South.✅ New supply is helping balance demand, offering tenants better choices.✅ Prime areas still see steady interest, but increases are slowing.What does this mean for investors and tenants?🏡 Tenants: This could be a good time to renegotiate leases or move to areas with better value.💰 Investors: The shift opens opportunities in emerging locations where supply is expanding and prices remain attractive.Are you seeing rental changes in your area? Let’s discuss below! ⬇️hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#InvestmentOpportunities hashtag#DubaiRentals hashtag#JVC hashtag#Arjan hashtag#Dubailand hashtag#DubaiSouth hashtag#UrbaneraProperties

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

The probe vibrates at high frequencies, rearranging granular soil particles (in this case, sea bed dredged sand) into a denser arrangement.🏝️ Damac - Amali Islands: A Vision of Luxury and ExclusivityIn the heart of The World Islands, Amali Islands is set to deliver 24+ exotic private beach villas, each offering breathtaking views of the Dubai skyline and crystal-clear waters.hashtag#Vibrocompaction hashtag#GeotechnicalEngineering hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#AmaliIslands hashtag#LuxuryLiving hashtag#TheWorldIslands hashtag#SustainableDevelopment hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#ConstructionTech hashtag#EngineeringMarvel hashtag#Villas hashtag#BeachfrontLiving hashtag#Dubai

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

This is where the technique of Vibrocompaction comes in—an advanced, efficient method used to densify loose or soft soils, creating a stronger, more stable foundation for structures to rise.Vibrocompaction is a geotechnical technique where a vibrating probe (known as a vibroflot) is inserted into the ground. The probe vibrates at high frequencies, rearranging granular soil particles (in this case, sea bed dredged sand) into a denser arrangement.🏝️ Damac - Amali Islands: A Vision of Luxury and ExclusivityIn the heart of The World Islands, Amali Islands is set to deliver 24+ exotic private beach villas, each offering breathtaking views of the Dubai skyline and crystal-clear waters.hashtag#Vibrocompaction hashtag#GeotechnicalEngineering hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#AmaliIslands hashtag#LuxuryLiving hashtag#TheWorldIslands hashtag#SustainableDevelopment hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#ConstructionTech hashtag#EngineeringMarvel hashtag#Villas hashtag#BeachfrontLiving hashtag#Dubai

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy. With record-breaking transactions expected and continuous infrastructure and policy improvements, the emirate is set to solidify its reputation as a leading global real estate destination.Source: Khaleej TimesFollow & share Our new page 👇🏻https://lnkd.in/dt-kqghu

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

This is where the technique of Vibrocompaction comes in—an advanced, efficient method used to densify loose or soft soils, creating a stronger, more stable foundation for structures to rise.Vibrocompaction is a geotechnical technique where a vibrating probe (known as a vibroflot) is inserted into the ground. The probe vibrates at high frequencies, rearranging granular soil particles (in this case, sea bed dredged sand) into a denser arrangement.🏝️ Damac - Amali Islands: A Vision of Luxury and ExclusivityIn the heart of The World Islands, Amali Islands is set to deliver 24+ exotic private beach villas, each offering breathtaking views of the Dubai skyline and crystal-clear waters.hashtag#Vibrocompaction hashtag#GeotechnicalEngineering hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#AmaliIslands hashtag#LuxuryLiving hashtag#TheWorldIslands hashtag#SustainableDevelopment hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#ConstructionTech hashtag#EngineeringMarvel hashtag#Villas hashtag#BeachfrontLiving hashtag#Dubai

Faisal Al HashmiFaisal Al Hashmi,,"🇦🇪 Dubai’s Real Estate Market Poised for Record-Breaking Year in 2024Dubai’s real estate sector is on track for an exceptional year in 2024, with total transactions projected to reach AED 1 trillion. Following a remarkable performance in 2023, property prices are expected to rise between 5% and 10%, driven by a combination of strong market fundamentals and government-backed initiatives.Key Growth Drivers 1.	Government Initiatives Fueling Demand •	Policies such as Dubai Economic Agenda D33 and the Golden Visa program continue to attract investors, expatriates, and high-net-worth individuals. •	Investor-friendly regulations and long-term residency options have strengthened Dubai’s position as a global property hub. 2.	Surge in Residential Supply •	More than 40,000 new residential units are expected to enter the market in 2024, catering to increasing demand across various segments, from luxury homes to affordable housing. •	The high-end luxury market and commercial real estate sectors are thriving, while budget-friendly housing options are gaining traction among middle-income buyers. 3.	Strong Investor Confidence & Foreign Capital Inflows •	Dubai remains one of the world’s most dynamic property markets, with international investors viewing it as a safe haven for capital appreciation and rental income. •	Attractive rental yields and tax-free incentives make the city a preferred destination for global real estate investment.Potential Challenges •	Price Stabilization: While property values are expected to rise, there may be a natural stabilization phase in the latter half of 2024, depending on supply and demand dynamics. •	Slower Growth in 2025: Some analysts predict that 2025 could see a slowdown in growth rates as the market absorbs new supply and economic conditions evolve.Outlook for 2024 & BeyondDespite potential challenges, Dubai’s real estate market remains resilient and robust, backed by strong policies, investor interest, and a diversified economy.

Hebroon QaiserHebroon Qaiser,,"""Impact of Rising Living Costs on Expats in Dubai""Dubai has long been a preferred destination for expatriates, offering world-class infrastructure, business opportunities, and a tax-free environment. However, the rising cost of living is putting increasing financial pressure on middle-income professionals.In 2025, despite strong economic growth and surging foreign direct investment (FDI), average salaries are expected to remain stagnant. Meanwhile, rents have increased by 16% year-on-year, making housing affordability a growing concern. Key areas such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah, and Dubai Marina have seen rental price hikes of up to 30%, forcing many professionals to relocate to more affordable suburban locations.Beyond housing, education, healthcare, and daily expenses have also risen, adding to financial strain. While companies are actively hiring, many employers are not increasing salaries in line with inflation, leaving expats to adjust their lifestyles or seek alternative income sources.Despite these challenges, Dubai remains an attractive market due to its business-friendly policies and career prospects. However, to sustain its appeal, companies may need to rethink compensation structures to align with the increasing cost of living.📢 How do you see this trend impacting professionals in Dubai?

Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified)Raihan Shaikh - Property Consultant (RERA Certified),,"📢 “Don’t buy by the number of bedrooms—buy by the square foot.” 🏙️💡In Dubai’s real estate market, square footage determines value, not bedroom count. Many buyers fall for the trap of more bedrooms in smaller spaces, but smart investors focus on price per square foot and long-term ROI. Here’s why:🏢 Price Per Sq. Ft. Drives the MarketA property with more bedrooms in a smaller space often comes at a higher price per square foot—meaning you’re paying more for less. A larger unit with fewer walls and better layout offers better value and resale potential.💸 Maximizing Rental IncomeIn Dubai’s competitive rental market, space = flexibility. Larger apartments or villas attract high-end tenants, corporate leases, and families looking for premium living experiences. A cramped apartment with multiple tiny bedrooms limits your rental options.🏙️ Changing Buyer PreferencesModern buyers prioritize livable, open spaces over extra bedrooms. The shift toward home offices and multifunctional layouts makes square footage more important than ever. A small, high-bedroom property might struggle to sell in the future.📈 Better Resale & AppreciationBigger units on spacious plots appreciate faster than smaller, high-bedroom properties. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for comfortable, adaptable living spaces, making larger properties a better long-term investment.🏠 More Flexibility & Future-ProofingReal estate trends evolve, and a larger space allows for renovations, luxury upgrades, and repurposing to meet changing demands. Smaller units with multiple bedrooms often feel cramped and outdated over time.Bottom Line:In Dubai’s booming market, bigger is better when it comes to square footage. It’s the key to higher ROI, stronger appreciation, and more investment flexibility.🔑 Looking for the right property?

As a recruiter, I've seen countless professionals thrive by embracing change and new cultures. Did you know that 60% of UK professionals have considered moving abroad for career opportunities?

This is where the technique of Vibrocompaction comes in—an advanced, efficient method used to densify loose or soft soils, creating a stronger, more stable foundation for structures to rise.Vibrocompaction is a geotechnical technique where a vibrating probe (known as a vibroflot) is inserted into the ground. The probe vibrates at high frequencies, rearranging granular soil particles (in this case, sea bed dredged sand) into a denser arrangement.🏝️ Damac - Amali Islands: A Vision of Luxury and ExclusivityIn the heart of The World Islands, Amali Islands is set to deliver 24+ exotic private beach villas, each offering breathtaking views of the Dubai skyline and crystal-clear waters.hashtag#Vibrocompaction hashtag#GeotechnicalEngineering hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#AmaliIslands hashtag#LuxuryLiving hashtag#TheWorldIslands hashtag#SustainableDevelopment hashtag#RealEstateInnovation hashtag#ConstructionTech hashtag#EngineeringMarvel hashtag#Villas hashtag#BeachfrontLiving hashtag#Dubai
