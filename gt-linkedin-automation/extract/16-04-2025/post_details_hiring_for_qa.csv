Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity

Nirdosh ChauhanNirdosh Chauhan,,"🔍 Manual Testing Still Matters — Especially in the Age of AII've been noticing a trend: most job postings in QA/Testing focus heavily on automation skills.

Amir SatvatAmir Satvat,,"People ask me all the time how to network.Here’s a short, tactical guide on how to actually do it - grounded in real data, real results, and 3,500+ jobs found through relationships.🎯 The #1 misconceptionNetworking is not: “Let me ask you for a job.”It is: “Let me have a real, human moment with someone in this industry.”✅ What actually worksThis is how you build meaningful professional relationships - the kind that lead to real opportunities:1️⃣ Be around.Events, Discords, social posts, games projects, ticket giveaways, community coaching - just show up. Start by being visible. Over time, become memorable for the right reasons.2️⃣ Don’t pitch. Connect.Ask questions. Be genuinely curious. You’re planting seeds, not harvesting. This takes months and years. There are not shortcuts to building real relationships.3️⃣ Look sideways, not up.A junior colleague can often help you more than a C-level exec. Build trust, first, with people at your level or just above it.4️⃣ Follow up like a human.Send messages that matter:“Just played [X] - loved the level design.”“Your GDC talk really stuck with me - thank you.”“Noticed you moved from QA to design - would love to hear how.”5️⃣ Give before you get.Share insights, leave helpful comments, support others’ work - anything that builds trust and makes you recognizable.6️⃣ Say hi when there’s nothing to gain.That’s the best time. No stakes, no pressure - it’s when real relationships start.7️⃣ Don’t just “shoot your shot.” ❌❌❌❌❌Never reach out with “Can you get me a job?” That closes doors, fast. Lead with curiosity and conversation, not a transactional, cold ask.🔥 If I wanted to be provocative…I’d say this: Applying to jobs without connective tissue is a waste of time.Cold applications have nearly zero odds of success for most.Instead of asking, “What should I apply to?” - ask, “Where can I build a relationship?”Posting about hundreds of applications is understandable, but it misses the point. Focus on how many real connections you’ve made - then work backward to the right applications.🧠 Avoid the Dream Company TrapToo many people focus only on the one studio they love - and end up pinging the same five people as everyone else.I always ask: Where do I already have network strength? Where can I go that everybody else isn’t going?We track 3,000+ game studios. 1,000+ of them hire. Go outside the top 50.🪜 Think in ladders and sidestepsInstead of aiming straight at your target studio, look at who owns that studio. Think conglomerates. Think sister teams. Adjacent verticals.📊 The data backs it up.Across our community:Cold apps: ~1–2% chanceApps with any warm connection: 10–20x+ better odds🧭 The shift is simpleSpend more time building bridges than sending résumés.Relationships are the infrastructure of hiring. Build that first.The first thing I ask anyone who's stuck is: Are you spending 80%+ of your effort building relationships? If not, do that.

Bich Le🥇Bich Le🥇,,"Is your tech hiring strategy still stuck in 2023 while the industry races ahead? Here are the hard truths about what's really happening in tech recruitment:🔄 Are ""Full-Stack"" Developers Becoming Obsolete?The jack-of-all-trades developer is rapidly becoming a liability rather than an asset. Companies now demand specialized expertise in cloud-native architecture, AI engineering, or platform development rather than settling for generalists.🤖 Why Are Non-AI Engineers Getting Left Behind?Technical professionals without AI literacy are becoming increasingly unmarketable regardless of their core expertise. Even traditional roles like QA and frontend development now require understanding of machine learning fundamentals and AI integration patterns.🔐 Is Your Team's Security Ignorance Your Biggest Vulnerability?Security expertise has shifted from a specialized role to a baseline requirement that many candidates falsely claim to possess. Companies are now rejecting otherwise qualified candidates who demonstrate security blindspots during technical interviews.🌐 Who's Getting Left Behind in the Remote Work Revolution?Engineers without distributed systems expertise are struggling to remain competitive in hybrid environments. Those who mastered edge computing, global data synchronization, and remote collaboration tools command premium salaries while others face stagnation.🔍 Why Are Pure Coders Rapidly Losing Value?Coding skills alone no longer differentiate candidates in a market flooded with technical talent. Engineers who can analyze data, translate insights into technical solutions, and communicate effectively across departments are eclipsing pure programmers.Is your recruitment strategy addressing these uncomfortable realities, or are you still hiring for yesterday's skills? What sacred hiring traditions are you willing to abandon to secure tomorrow's talent?hashtag#TechDisruption hashtag#ITRecruitment hashtag#AISkills hashtag#TalentStrategy hashtag#FutureOfWork

khairul affankhairul affan,,"Nak share satu pengalaman interview masa raya ke3.Masih sedar di ingatan.Position lebih kepada cybersecurity engineer.Apply melalui jobstreet. Ada 3 stage.Stage 1 - by phone , Head IT Infra call scanning aku punya experience selama 8-9tahun. Dia minta aku share updated CV .Stage 2 - by phone , Head  IT infra call sekali lagi minta aku share details apa experience aku dan skill aku dalam cybersecurity dan kenapa aku nak join dorang punya team.Stage 3- Online IV dengan Head IT department bersama IT Infra - MS Teams session.Sedikit perkongsian - tempoh hampir 2 jam sesi QA bersulam tentang diri , experience, technical skill, projek dan sebagainya.Dalam diri aku - ""kalau sesi sampai 2 jam ni , kalau still aku tak dapat position ni , something wrong"".10 minit terakhir , Head IT Department minta left dulu sebab dia ada meeting lain , tinggal aku dengan Head Infra . Ayat Head Infra "" saya berminat untuk hired awak tapi at the end all decision and approval from Head IT Department , dia cakap dia akan discuss next Monday bila bertemu di office "" , so di sini aku sangat happy. Pengakhiran untuk position ni - TIDAK BERJAYA.Respond dari Head Infra -  ""Head IT need someone can do the pentest , im so sorry, i actually interested to hired you but all decision and approval comes from Head IT""Aku agak kecewa sebenar sebab memang yakin dapat tapi bila aku check balik JD dalam jobstreet - tidak ada mention untuk position tu adalah pentester . Hanya ada mention have experience handle VA and penetration test and take action from the report. Head IT  Infra ada mention yang VA dan Penetration Test will conduct by vendor, as cybersecurity engineer , ambil action untuk mitigate vulnerability.Lesson learn :1 - Tidak bermakna sesi iv sampai 2 jam kita adalah best candidate.2- Tidak bermakna match JD dengan experience  adalah skillset yang di perlukan  bila masuk kerja.3- Lagi banyak soalan kita tanya lagi bagus untuk kita assume apa scope kerja sebenar utk position itu4-Saya puji kepada Head IT Infra sebab dia feedback dalam masa seminggu. kebiasaan nya hiring suka ghost candidate yang company tak berminat. hashtag#opentowork hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#networksecurity hashtag#firewall hashtag#endpoint hashtag#knowbe4 hashtag#manageengine hashtag#itsecurity
