Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making.

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

You keep what you earn.✅ Strong Currency Hedge – With fluctuating rupee/ruble rates, investing in a stable USD-pegged market like Dubai provides long-term safety.✅ High ROI Opportunities – Projects in JVC, Arjan, and Dubai South are still delivering 7%–10%+ annual rental returns.✅ Golden Visa Benefits – Buy property and secure 10-year residency for you and your family.✅ Developer Confidence – Top Indian and Russian HNIs are booking multiple units in launches by Emaar, Damac, Sobha, and Danube.💡 Many investors are shifting from buying 1 unit → to full-floor and building acquisitions.hashtag#investindubai hashtag#wealthcreation

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi & UAE Job Market in 2025. What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Why Dubai Isn’t Just a Trend, It’s the UpgradeImagine a global game of Monopoly where London raises your taxes, New York steals your time, and Dubai hands you a sun drenched, tax free ‘Get Out of Jail Free’ card.In 2024, 6,700 millionaires moved to the UAE, not for hype, but for hard economics and smart living:🔹 Prime property grew 6.8% in 2024🔹 Forecast: 8–10% growth in 2025🔹 Safety + multiculturalism + zero income tax = irresistible🔹 School enrolment jumped 6%, proving this isn’t a pit stop it’s a permanent move.But here’s what’s more interesting…Abu Dhabi is quietly becoming the region’s quiet giant, offering a deep economic base, sovereign wealth strength, and a rising reputation for innovation and education. Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi? They're pulling people in with vision, stability, and lifestyle.It’s not just about real estate anymore, it’s about recalibrating priorities: better return on life, not just investment.This is more than a market trend. It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi? They're pulling people in with vision, stability, and lifestyle.It’s not just about real estate anymore, it’s about recalibrating priorities: better return on life, not just investment.This is more than a market trend. It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Shanna May B.Shanna May B.,,"“Sticking around until it works” sounds noble.But let’s be honest especially in Dubai real estate, it’s often fear in disguise.We hold on.To people. To partnerships. To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making.

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Shanna May B.Shanna May B.,,"“Sticking around until it works” sounds noble.But let’s be honest especially in Dubai real estate, it’s often fear in disguise.We hold on.To people. To partnerships. To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity.

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi? They're pulling people in with vision, stability, and lifestyle.It’s not just about real estate anymore, it’s about recalibrating priorities: better return on life, not just investment.This is more than a market trend. It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Shanna May B.Shanna May B.,,"“Sticking around until it works” sounds noble.But let’s be honest especially in Dubai real estate, it’s often fear in disguise.We hold on.To people. To partnerships. To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Shanna May B.Shanna May B.,,"“Sticking around until it works” sounds noble.But let’s be honest especially in Dubai real estate, it’s often fear in disguise.We hold on.To people. To partnerships. To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi?

It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity.

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi & UAE Job Market in 2025. What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi?

It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound.

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

You keep what you earn.✅ Strong Currency Hedge – With fluctuating rupee/ruble rates, investing in a stable USD-pegged market like Dubai provides long-term safety.✅ High ROI Opportunities – Projects in JVC, Arjan, and Dubai South are still delivering 7%–10%+ annual rental returns.✅ Golden Visa Benefits – Buy property and secure 10-year residency for you and your family.✅ Developer Confidence – Top Indian and Russian HNIs are booking multiple units in launches by Emaar, Damac, Sobha, and Danube.💡 Many investors are shifting from buying 1 unit → to full-floor and building acquisitions.hashtag#investindubai hashtag#wealthcreation

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi?

It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Shanna May B.Shanna May B.,,"“Sticking around until it works” sounds noble.But let’s be honest especially in Dubai real estate, it’s often fear in disguise.We hold on.To people. To partnerships. To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making.

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

You keep what you earn.✅ Strong Currency Hedge – With fluctuating rupee/ruble rates, investing in a stable USD-pegged market like Dubai provides long-term safety.✅ High ROI Opportunities – Projects in JVC, Arjan, and Dubai South are still delivering 7%–10%+ annual rental returns.✅ Golden Visa Benefits – Buy property and secure 10-year residency for you and your family.✅ Developer Confidence – Top Indian and Russian HNIs are booking multiple units in launches by Emaar, Damac, Sobha, and Danube.💡 Many investors are shifting from buying 1 unit → to full-floor and building acquisitions.hashtag#investindubai hashtag#wealthcreation

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi? They're pulling people in with vision, stability, and lifestyle.It’s not just about real estate anymore, it’s about recalibrating priorities: better return on life, not just investment.This is more than a market trend. It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Shanna May B.Shanna May B.,,"“Sticking around until it works” sounds noble.But let’s be honest especially in Dubai real estate, it’s often fear in disguise.We hold on.To people. To partnerships. To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi & UAE Job Market in 2025. What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi?

It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

Justin McGuireJustin McGuire,,"The Saudi & UAE Job Market in 2025. What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi?

It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

The initial rounds with Mr.Gopal Sharma and Mr.Dilip Kumar went smoothly, focusing on database technologies. However, my experience took a negative turn during the third round with Nishant Garg, the VP of DevOps.Nishant joined the meeting late without an apology and adopted a disrespectful tone throughout. He veered off-topic, asking irrelevant questions related to a different role, and disregarding my previous interview rounds. When I raised this issue, he abruptly ended the interview dismissively.Such behavior, especially from a leader, is unacceptable. Candidates deserve respect, transparency, and professionalism during the hiring process. It reflects poorly on the company's culture and coordination when these values are disregarded.For those considering Junglee Games, I urge you to reconsider your decision.

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making.

You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity.

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

His emphasis on being fast, bold and integrated highlights what’s truly needed in today’s fast changing health care environment. Innovation doesn't thrive in comfort zones, it demands speed in execution, boldness in vision and collaboration across all levels.His reminder that ""you can't win alone"" also struck a chord. In healthcare especially, success isn't individual, it’s collective.

The initial rounds with Mr.Gopal Sharma and Mr.Dilip Kumar went smoothly, focusing on database technologies. However, my experience took a negative turn during the third round with Nishant Garg, the VP of DevOps.Nishant joined the meeting late without an apology and adopted a disrespectful tone throughout. He veered off-topic, asking irrelevant questions related to a different role, and disregarding my previous interview rounds. When I raised this issue, he abruptly ended the interview dismissively.Such behavior, especially from a leader, is unacceptable. Candidates deserve respect, transparency, and professionalism during the hiring process. It reflects poorly on the company's culture and coordination when these values are disregarded.For those considering Junglee Games, I urge you to reconsider your decision. Transparency, respect, and alignment are crucial aspects that should never be compromised in any hiring process. hashtag#InterviewExperience hashtag#JungleeGames hashtag#DatabaseEngineer hashtag#RespectForCandidates hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#SayNoToToxicCulture @ DBA Group # Ankush Gera hashtag#SeniorAgileProject hashtaghashtag#ProductManager hashtaghashtag#agile hashtaghashtag#jira hashtaghashtag#immediatejoiner

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

Shanna May B.Shanna May B.,,"“Sticking around until it works” sounds noble.But let’s be honest especially in Dubai real estate, it’s often fear in disguise.We hold on.To people. To partnerships. To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

What’s Really Going On.The hiring market’s still moving in both Saudi and the UAE.But it’s definitely not the same.Here’s what we’re seeing on the ground at MCG Talent, backed up by the data:• 75% of professionals in KSA and UAE plan to look for a new job this year• 58% are thinking about switching industries completely• But 43% say the whole job search process is frustrating• And nearly half of applicants say they’re applying for more roles but hearing less backThat’s the disconnect.At the same time, the economic picture is a mix:Saudi Arabia• Growth forecast now down to 3.3%, mainly due to extended oil production cuts• Brent crude hit below $60 a barrel — a 15% drop• Still, hiring is active in digital, tourism, comms, and giga projects• Vision 2030 is alive and kicking, but local talent is now the top priorityUAE• Non-oil sector projected to grow 5.1% in 2025• AI, fintech, and sustainability jobs are surging• There’s a real push on tech talent and a serious push for local market knowledge• Salaries are under serious pressure due to higher competition and more expats arrivingAnd the annoyance for many: the U.S. has now slapped 10% tariffs on some UAE and KSA exports.That’s shaking things up, fast-tracking diversification, and making hiring even more strategic.What needs to happen now:• Candidates - Stop applying for everything. Target properly. Get specific.• Employers - You can’t just post a job and hope. Blend local hires with offshore support and upskill your people.• Recruiters - Post-and-pray is dead. Go outbound. Build real relationships.• Everyone -Get good with AI, data, communication, and decision-making. That’s what the top roles demand.Saudi and the UAE are still growingBut you need to adapt, fast.The window’s open, but it is getting harder and with the erratic behavious in teh White House, it will be interesting to see how the year progresss.MCG Talent7-Figure Recruitment Scaling SystemsRemote ResourceBeyond the Business Card Podcast

Ibrahim Al ObaidlyIbrahim Al Obaidly,,"Thinking of stepping into hashtag#entrepreneurship? 🚩Pause for a moment and reflect.Starting with an idea you truly believe in is essential — but belief alone isn’t enough. You must be ready to learn continuously, build strong networks, work hard, and constantly innovate.But above all — never underestimate analysis and planning.Conducting proper market research, developing a clear business plan, and applying and regularly updating it are vital to ensure sustainability and business continuity. Entering the entrepreneurial path without proper preparation and management can lead to significant losses, especially as you progress to more advanced stages.Failure isn’t the end — but it’s inevitable if you ignore the tools of success.The UAE is a land of opportunities, but success requires a genuine commitment to self and societal development, and a deep understanding of the market — not just enthusiasm or haste.hashtag#Entrepreneurship hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessTips hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#MarketResearch hashtag#BusinessPlanning hashtag#StrategicThinkingهل تنوي دخول عالم hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال؟🚩 توقف للحظة، وفكّر جيدًا.أن تبدأ بفكرة تؤمن بها بصدق هو أساس الانطلاقة، لكن الصدق وحده لا يكفي. من المهم أن تكون مستعدًا للتعلّم المستمر، وأن تبني شبكة علاقات قوية، وتعمل بجد، وتبتكر باستمرار.لكن الأهم من كل ذلك — لا تستهين بالتحليل، ولا تهمل التخطيط.دراسة السوق، ووضع خطة تجارية واضحة، وتطبيقها وتحديثها بشكل دوري هي عناصر أساسية لضمان الاستدامة واستمرارية الأعمال. الدخول في عالم ريادة الأعمال دون تحضير وإدارة دقيقة قد يؤدي إلى خسائر أكبر كلما تقدّمت في المراحل.الفشل ليس نهاية الطريق، لكنه حتمي إذا تجاهلت أدوات النجاح.الإمارات أرض الفرص، لكن النجاح فيها يتطلب التزامًا حقيقيًا بالتطوير الذاتي والمجتمعي، وبناء مشاريع قائمة على فهم عميق للسوق وليس فقط الحماس أو التسرع.hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال hashtag#الإمارات hashtag#نصائح_لرواد_الأعمال hashtag#الاستدامة hashtag#دراسة_السوق hashtag#خطط_العمل hashtag#التحليل_الاستراتيجي

You keep what you earn.✅ Strong Currency Hedge – With fluctuating rupee/ruble rates, investing in a stable USD-pegged market like Dubai provides long-term safety.✅ High ROI Opportunities – Projects in JVC, Arjan, and Dubai South are still delivering 7%–10%+ annual rental returns.✅ Golden Visa Benefits – Buy property and secure 10-year residency for you and your family.✅ Developer Confidence – Top Indian and Russian HNIs are booking multiple units in launches by Emaar, Damac, Sobha, and Danube.💡 Many investors are shifting from buying 1 unit → to full-floor and building acquisitions.hashtag#investindubai hashtag#wealthcreation

Stock may be limited, but demand isn’t.Meanwhile, traditional HNW hotspots are pushing people out with high taxes, crime and unstable economies. Dubai and Abu Dhabi?

It’s a tectonic shift in how the world defines value.And the GCC Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha, they're becoming the new centers of gravity.If you’re still waiting for a “sign” to move, invest, or advise your clients accordingly, this is it.Dubai isn’t just open for business.

Aazer Qureshi🏅Aazer Qureshi🏅,,"TRUMP'S TARRIF WAR AND IT'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON DUBAI REAL ESTATE:There is considerable discussion surrounding Trump's tariff war and its potential impact on Dubai's real estate prices.Dubai property prices have experienced a significant 70% surge over the past four years, surpassing other major cities. However, this flourishing trend now faces a substantial challenge due to the uncertainties caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs.As of the first half of 2024, non-oil sectors in UAE have notably contributed around 75% to the country's GDP, showcasing a decreased dependence on oil revenues. Remarkably, 98% of real estate transactions were unrelated to oil, suggesting a diversified market. Based on these insights, predicting a real estate correction becomes a complex task.On the contrary, an alternative perspective suggests that real estate entities in the UAE might silently appreciate the actions of the US President. The Gulf country's property sector is anticipated to witness significant gains in the forthcoming period. Trump's unorthodox policies and tariff declarations have led to a depreciation of the US dollar, subsequently devaluing the dirham. This scenario is expected to prompt a surge in foreign investments in the real estate sector, particularly from Europe, Russia, and India.hashtag#dubai hashtag#number1 hashtag#realestate hashtag#nonoilGDP hashtag#resilience

To routines.Even when the energy is off and the results are not met.Not out of belief but because starting over feels harder than staying stuck.I’ve seen it in sales the same trap:→ Holding onto agents who’ve lost the drive because letting go feels uncomfortable→ Forcing strategies that no longer align→ Staying in deals, dynamics, or connections that drain more than they deliverDubai rewards speed. Clarity. Courage.And every day you delay the hard decision?You lose —Time. Focus. Sanity. Growth.The truth?You’re allowed to walk away.From the client who doesn’t respect your time.From the teammate who’s not aligned.From the version of you that’s playing it safe.Letting go isn’t quitting — it’s creating space.For the deals that flow.The people who match your energy.The relationships that align with your values.The next level you’ve been putting off.In this city, staying stuck is the only thing you can’t afford.hashtag#investinoffplan hashtag#dubairealestate

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Ekaterina NomokonovaEkaterina Nomokonova,,"So let’s talk and think : Why larger apartments will see stronger Capital Appreciation on Dubai Islands?Dubai’s real estate market is evolving, and one trend is becoming clear: larger apartments are set to outperform smaller units in terms of capital appreciation—especially on Dubai Islands. Why?1. Shift Toward Spacious LivingPost-pandemic lifestyle changes have increased demand for bigger homes with space for remote work, family life, and wellness. Dubai Islands, with its low-density beachfront setting, is ideal for this shift.2. Limited SupplyMost projects offer a limited number of 3- and 4-bedroom units and almost never 5- bedrooms, compared to 1 and 2-beds. This scarcity makes them more exclusive and more likely to appreciate in value over time.3. Rising Construction and Land Costs With land and material costs on the rise, especially in waterfront areas, future launches will be priced higher. Buying a larger apartment now means entering below the next pricing wave.4. End-User Demand Larger apartments attract end-users, not just investors. These buyers are typically less price-sensitive and stay longer, making your asset more stable and valuable in the long run.5. Dubai Islands as a Premium AddressAs infrastructure, luxury hotels, and beach clubs roll out, Dubai Islands is set to become the next iconic coastal destination. Properties with sea views and spacious layouts will benefit the most.Spotlight on Villa del Gavi & Villa del Divos Two standout projects leading this trend are Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos. Both offer limited collections of ultra-luxurious residences up to 5-bedroom layouts, Italian finishes, and rare beachfront access. With their boutique designs, resort-style amenities, and exclusive lifestyle services—including a private Riva boat and Rolls Royce fleet—they are positioned to deliver strong long-term value for both end-users and investors.If you're investing for long-term growth, think bigger. On Dubai Islands, larger units offer the perfect blend of lifestyle appeal, exclusivity, and capital appreciation potential—especially in standout projects like Villa del Gavi and Villa del Divos.

The initiative was designed to simplify the government housing journey for UAE citizens by streamlining procedures, reducing the number of steps, enhancing inter-governmental integration, and accelerating the delivery of housing services.This recognition embodies the UAE Government’s bold vision to shape a future free of bureaucracy — one that is centered around agility, efficiency, and placing people first.hashtag#ZeroBureaucracyhashtag#UAEGovernment hashtag#ManziliBundlehashtag#MinistryofEnergyandInfrastructure_MOEIhashtag#InnovationInGovernment

It pushes you, it grows you, it spoils you a little too. And if you’re smart… it pays you back.This isn’t just where people live, it’s where they build.

Vedprakash SharmaVedprakash Sharma,,"🔥Beware: Toxic Interview Culture at Junglee Games !I recently went through the interview process at Junglee Games for the Database Engineer role. The initial rounds with Mr.Gopal Sharma and Mr.Dilip Kumar went smoothly, focusing on database technologies. However, my experience took a negative turn during the third round with Nishant Garg, the VP of DevOps.Nishant joined the meeting late without an apology and adopted a disrespectful tone throughout. He veered off-topic, asking irrelevant questions related to a different role, and disregarding my previous interview rounds. When I raised this issue, he abruptly ended the interview dismissively.Such behavior, especially from a leader, is unacceptable. Candidates deserve respect, transparency, and professionalism during the hiring process. It reflects poorly on the company's culture and coordination when these values are disregarded.For those considering Junglee Games, I urge you to reconsider your decision. Transparency, respect, and alignment are crucial aspects that should never be compromised in any hiring process. hashtag#InterviewExperience hashtag#JungleeGames hashtag#DatabaseEngineer hashtag#RespectForCandidates hashtag#HiringPractices hashtag#SayNoToToxicCulture @ DBA Group # Ankush Gera hashtag#SeniorAgileProject hashtaghashtag#ProductManager hashtaghashtag#agile hashtaghashtag#jira hashtaghashtag#immediatejoiner
