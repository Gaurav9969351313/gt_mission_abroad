Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Talha NakhwaTalha Nakhwa,,"🛑The Biggest Scam on Linkedin🛑""I am hiring for multiple positions""Like this post and comment I am interested and we will review your profile.Share your email and phone number, and we will contact you.Warning: No recruiter or talent acquisition professional will ever hire talent in such an unprofessional way.These scammers are simply creating a database from your responses and boosting their visibility nothing more.These so-called job positions don't even exist.For example, positions like ""POSITION NAME (HR Recruiter) EXPERIENCE (0-5y) & Freshers including 12th passOpportunities where they provide their phone number instead of an email ID or company website link are biggest red flags.Stay cautious!hashtag#scam hashtag#scamalert hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinscam hashtag#stayalert hashtag#Staysafe hashtag#opentowork

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.

Shubham KumarShubham Kumar,,"""Hiring non-stop? But people are quietly quitting?"" As a fresher, I keep seeing ‘We’re hiring!’ posts filled with fireworks and excitement...But it makes me wonder — if so many people are joining,Why are the current ones leaving silently?That’s not just growth — that might be 🚰 leaky bucket syndrome.Maybe it’s not just about hiring more.Maybe it’s about what’s making people leave in the first place: 👉 A toxic work culture? 👉 Lack of growth or recognition? 👉 Too much micromanagement? 👉 Or maybe just too many “motivational” 9 AM Zoom calls? 😅As someone looking to start their journey, I’ve realized:Strong teams aren’t built by constantly replacing people.They’re built by listening, valuing, and retaining them.Because in the long run —Retention > Recruitment.
