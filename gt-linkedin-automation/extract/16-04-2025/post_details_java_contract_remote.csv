Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Gusttavo BrilhânteGusttavo Brilhânte,,"What I Learned Migrating a Project from Java to KotlinI recently worked on migrating a legacy Android app from Java to Kotlin — and the difference was huge. It wasn't just about productivity, but also code clarity and safety.✨ Key takeaways from the journey:Null safety eliminated several crashes we had been patching for yearsData classes and extension functions massively reduced boilerplateCode readability improved so much it made onboarding new devs easierCoroutines allowed us to rewrite complex callback chains in a much cleaner wayMigration takes effort, but the benefits are real. Kotlin isn’t just “modern syntax” — it’s about long-term productivity and maintainability.👨‍💻 Have you been part of a similar migration?

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Gusttavo BrilhânteGusttavo Brilhânte,,"What I Learned Migrating a Project from Java to KotlinI recently worked on migrating a legacy Android app from Java to Kotlin — and the difference was huge. It wasn't just about productivity, but also code clarity and safety.✨ Key takeaways from the journey:Null safety eliminated several crashes we had been patching for yearsData classes and extension functions massively reduced boilerplateCode readability improved so much it made onboarding new devs easierCoroutines allowed us to rewrite complex callback chains in a much cleaner wayMigration takes effort, but the benefits are real. Kotlin isn’t just “modern syntax” — it’s about long-term productivity and maintainability.👨‍💻 Have you been part of a similar migration?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification. This is a nice collaboration between AVL (including AVL DiTEST) and Mälardalen University in the AIDOaRt project.Co-authors:David Schögler Marjan Sirjani Mikael Sjödin The best thing: it's open access.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

SARMAD WAQASSARMAD WAQAS,,"Why do so many projects stumble despite having skilled contractors on board?The answer often lies not in the contractor’s capabilities — but in the strength of the relationship between the client and contractor.A successful partnership goes beyond contracts and deadlines. It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

SARMAD WAQASSARMAD WAQAS,,"Why do so many projects stumble despite having skilled contractors on board?The answer often lies not in the contractor’s capabilities — but in the strength of the relationship between the client and contractor.A successful partnership goes beyond contracts and deadlines. It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Gusttavo BrilhânteGusttavo Brilhânte,,"What I Learned Migrating a Project from Java to KotlinI recently worked on migrating a legacy Android app from Java to Kotlin — and the difference was huge. It wasn't just about productivity, but also code clarity and safety.✨ Key takeaways from the journey:Null safety eliminated several crashes we had been patching for yearsData classes and extension functions massively reduced boilerplateCode readability improved so much it made onboarding new devs easierCoroutines allowed us to rewrite complex callback chains in a much cleaner wayMigration takes effort, but the benefits are real. Kotlin isn’t just “modern syntax” — it’s about long-term productivity and maintainability.👨‍💻 Have you been part of a similar migration?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification. This is a nice collaboration between AVL (including AVL DiTEST) and Mälardalen University in the AIDOaRt project.Co-authors:David Schögler Marjan Sirjani Mikael Sjödin The best thing: it's open access.

SARMAD WAQASSARMAD WAQAS,,"Why do so many projects stumble despite having skilled contractors on board?The answer often lies not in the contractor’s capabilities — but in the strength of the relationship between the client and contractor.A successful partnership goes beyond contracts and deadlines. It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Verdi OgewellVerdi Ogewell,,"WORLD PREMIERE: Leading Nordic Steel Supplier TIBNOR Bets Big on SAP’s New Cloud-Based Real-Time PlatformMeet DAG ÅSELIUS, senior IT advisor at Tibnor and former long-time CIO, commenting why the company became FIRST IN THE WORLD to IMPLEMENT SAP's new Business Cloud Platform. One of the more interesting news stories in the business systems area this week is that leading distributor of steel, non-ferrous metals and processing services in the Nordics, Tibnor, became first among SAP customers to implement the new SAP Business Data Cloud solution.Why is it big? For several reasons, but perhaps the most important is that this platform represents a landmark as a symbol of where the digitalization wave can lead. A heavy point is the magic that can happen when two leaders in their respective domains, SAP and Databricks, come together to redefine how applications and platforms can work together. The new solution builds Databricks' world-leading technology around data science, machine learning and AI workloads into SAP’s Business Data Cloud platform. This, combined with SAP's expertise in business-critical and comprehensive processes can unleash new levels of values in the context of business data and AI; which Tibnor has now embraced before others:""We have always tried to stay one step ahead in our industry. With SAP Business Data Cloud, new windows opportunities were opened up to quickly integrate with external information, which we could not even imagine a few years ago,"" says Tibnor's Dag Åselius.The investment also fits well into the digitalization efforts that are a central part of Tibnor's business strategy. By investing in standard tools and preparing for a generational change of employees, they have managed to take a position far ahead in the market. After a successful transition to the cloud-based ERP system SAP S/4HANA, they wanted to take another step and be able to connect external data sources.This is not a bad idea for a player like Tibnor. A good example of how you can make better business decisions is the ability to interact in real time with relevant external sources such as, in the case of Tibnor, the London Metal Exchange. As a cloud-based SaaS service, SAP Business Data Cloud can connect to this exchange in real time, which provides excellent opportunities to quickly adapt business decisions to market fluctuations, which are particularly frequent on most types of exchanges and important for the business outcome.“But we have more in our vision of what we can do with the solution,” says Åselius. “One such is to combine all old and new business data in one application and use an AI engine for our pricing. These are complex things because customers are in many different segments such as construction, engineering and the process industry.”But there is more in the planning.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Gusttavo BrilhânteGusttavo Brilhânte,,"What I Learned Migrating a Project from Java to KotlinI recently worked on migrating a legacy Android app from Java to Kotlin — and the difference was huge. It wasn't just about productivity, but also code clarity and safety.✨ Key takeaways from the journey:Null safety eliminated several crashes we had been patching for yearsData classes and extension functions massively reduced boilerplateCode readability improved so much it made onboarding new devs easierCoroutines allowed us to rewrite complex callback chains in a much cleaner wayMigration takes effort, but the benefits are real. Kotlin isn’t just “modern syntax” — it’s about long-term productivity and maintainability.👨‍💻 Have you been part of a similar migration?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification. This is a nice collaboration between AVL (including AVL DiTEST) and Mälardalen University in the AIDOaRt project.Co-authors:David Schögler Marjan Sirjani Mikael Sjödin The best thing: it's open access.

It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Verdi OgewellVerdi Ogewell,,"WORLD PREMIERE: Leading Nordic Steel Supplier TIBNOR Bets Big on SAP’s New Cloud-Based Real-Time PlatformMeet DAG ÅSELIUS, senior IT advisor at Tibnor and former long-time CIO, commenting why the company became FIRST IN THE WORLD to IMPLEMENT SAP's new Business Cloud Platform. One of the more interesting news stories in the business systems area this week is that leading distributor of steel, non-ferrous metals and processing services in the Nordics, Tibnor, became first among SAP customers to implement the new SAP Business Data Cloud solution.Why is it big? For several reasons, but perhaps the most important is that this platform represents a landmark as a symbol of where the digitalization wave can lead. A heavy point is the magic that can happen when two leaders in their respective domains, SAP and Databricks, come together to redefine how applications and platforms can work together. The new solution builds Databricks' world-leading technology around data science, machine learning and AI workloads into SAP’s Business Data Cloud platform. This, combined with SAP's expertise in business-critical and comprehensive processes can unleash new levels of values in the context of business data and AI; which Tibnor has now embraced before others:""We have always tried to stay one step ahead in our industry. With SAP Business Data Cloud, new windows opportunities were opened up to quickly integrate with external information, which we could not even imagine a few years ago,"" says Tibnor's Dag Åselius.The investment also fits well into the digitalization efforts that are a central part of Tibnor's business strategy. By investing in standard tools and preparing for a generational change of employees, they have managed to take a position far ahead in the market. After a successful transition to the cloud-based ERP system SAP S/4HANA, they wanted to take another step and be able to connect external data sources.This is not a bad idea for a player like Tibnor. A good example of how you can make better business decisions is the ability to interact in real time with relevant external sources such as, in the case of Tibnor, the London Metal Exchange. As a cloud-based SaaS service, SAP Business Data Cloud can connect to this exchange in real time, which provides excellent opportunities to quickly adapt business decisions to market fluctuations, which are particularly frequent on most types of exchanges and important for the business outcome.“But we have more in our vision of what we can do with the solution,” says Åselius. “One such is to combine all old and new business data in one application and use an AI engine for our pricing. These are complex things because customers are in many different segments such as construction, engineering and the process industry.”But there is more in the planning.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

SARMAD WAQASSARMAD WAQAS,,"Why do so many projects stumble despite having skilled contractors on board?The answer often lies not in the contractor’s capabilities — but in the strength of the relationship between the client and contractor.A successful partnership goes beyond contracts and deadlines. It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders. Collaborative problem-solving and mutual respect turn vendors into long-term allies.Strong contractor relationships reduce risks, increase project efficiency, and drive better outcomes.Let’s move beyond transactions — and start building real partnerships.What strategies have helped you build lasting contractor relationships?Share your experience in the comments!hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Collaboration hashtag#Contractors hashtag#Teamwork hashtag#PMP hashtag#PMO

Gideon EmenikeGideon Emenike,,"The Unbeatable Keys to Winning Contracts - hashtag#ACCURACY & hashtag#COMPLETENESSEver lost a bid and wondered, ""What exactly went wrong?"" 🤔 Here’s the hard truth: Most contracts aren’t lost on pricing or capability alone— they’re lost on overlooked details. A single missing document, an unchecked compliance box, or a vague technical response can disqualify even the strongest bidder. So, how do you ensure your proposal is airtight?Start with the hashtag#Tender_Summary — your blueprint for success. Here are what you MUST nail: ✅ Key Tender Facts – Capture specific instructions peculiar to tender✅ Scope Clarity – Did you hashtag#fully understand the client’s requirements, or did you assume? ✅ Submission Deadlines – Late = automatic disqualification.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Verdi OgewellVerdi Ogewell,,"WORLD PREMIERE: Leading Nordic Steel Supplier TIBNOR Bets Big on SAP’s New Cloud-Based Real-Time PlatformMeet DAG ÅSELIUS, senior IT advisor at Tibnor and former long-time CIO, commenting why the company became FIRST IN THE WORLD to IMPLEMENT SAP's new Business Cloud Platform. One of the more interesting news stories in the business systems area this week is that leading distributor of steel, non-ferrous metals and processing services in the Nordics, Tibnor, became first among SAP customers to implement the new SAP Business Data Cloud solution.Why is it big? For several reasons, but perhaps the most important is that this platform represents a landmark as a symbol of where the digitalization wave can lead. A heavy point is the magic that can happen when two leaders in their respective domains, SAP and Databricks, come together to redefine how applications and platforms can work together. The new solution builds Databricks' world-leading technology around data science, machine learning and AI workloads into SAP’s Business Data Cloud platform. This, combined with SAP's expertise in business-critical and comprehensive processes can unleash new levels of values in the context of business data and AI; which Tibnor has now embraced before others:""We have always tried to stay one step ahead in our industry. With SAP Business Data Cloud, new windows opportunities were opened up to quickly integrate with external information, which we could not even imagine a few years ago,"" says Tibnor's Dag Åselius.The investment also fits well into the digitalization efforts that are a central part of Tibnor's business strategy. By investing in standard tools and preparing for a generational change of employees, they have managed to take a position far ahead in the market. After a successful transition to the cloud-based ERP system SAP S/4HANA, they wanted to take another step and be able to connect external data sources.This is not a bad idea for a player like Tibnor. A good example of how you can make better business decisions is the ability to interact in real time with relevant external sources such as, in the case of Tibnor, the London Metal Exchange. As a cloud-based SaaS service, SAP Business Data Cloud can connect to this exchange in real time, which provides excellent opportunities to quickly adapt business decisions to market fluctuations, which are particularly frequent on most types of exchanges and important for the business outcome.“But we have more in our vision of what we can do with the solution,” says Åselius. “One such is to combine all old and new business data in one application and use an AI engine for our pricing. These are complex things because customers are in many different segments such as construction, engineering and the process industry.”But there is more in the planning.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Verdi OgewellVerdi Ogewell,,"WORLD PREMIERE: Leading Nordic Steel Supplier TIBNOR Bets Big on SAP’s New Cloud-Based Real-Time PlatformMeet DAG ÅSELIUS, senior IT advisor at Tibnor and former long-time CIO, commenting why the company became FIRST IN THE WORLD to IMPLEMENT SAP's new Business Cloud Platform. One of the more interesting news stories in the business systems area this week is that leading distributor of steel, non-ferrous metals and processing services in the Nordics, Tibnor, became first among SAP customers to implement the new SAP Business Data Cloud solution.Why is it big? For several reasons, but perhaps the most important is that this platform represents a landmark as a symbol of where the digitalization wave can lead. A heavy point is the magic that can happen when two leaders in their respective domains, SAP and Databricks, come together to redefine how applications and platforms can work together. The new solution builds Databricks' world-leading technology around data science, machine learning and AI workloads into SAP’s Business Data Cloud platform. This, combined with SAP's expertise in business-critical and comprehensive processes can unleash new levels of values in the context of business data and AI; which Tibnor has now embraced before others:""We have always tried to stay one step ahead in our industry. With SAP Business Data Cloud, new windows opportunities were opened up to quickly integrate with external information, which we could not even imagine a few years ago,"" says Tibnor's Dag Åselius.The investment also fits well into the digitalization efforts that are a central part of Tibnor's business strategy. By investing in standard tools and preparing for a generational change of employees, they have managed to take a position far ahead in the market. After a successful transition to the cloud-based ERP system SAP S/4HANA, they wanted to take another step and be able to connect external data sources.This is not a bad idea for a player like Tibnor. A good example of how you can make better business decisions is the ability to interact in real time with relevant external sources such as, in the case of Tibnor, the London Metal Exchange. As a cloud-based SaaS service, SAP Business Data Cloud can connect to this exchange in real time, which provides excellent opportunities to quickly adapt business decisions to market fluctuations, which are particularly frequent on most types of exchanges and important for the business outcome.“But we have more in our vision of what we can do with the solution,” says Åselius. “One such is to combine all old and new business data in one application and use an AI engine for our pricing. These are complex things because customers are in many different segments such as construction, engineering and the process industry.”But there is more in the planning.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Verdi OgewellVerdi Ogewell,,"WORLD PREMIERE: Leading Nordic Steel Supplier TIBNOR Bets Big on SAP’s New Cloud-Based Real-Time PlatformMeet DAG ÅSELIUS, senior IT advisor at Tibnor and former long-time CIO, commenting why the company became FIRST IN THE WORLD to IMPLEMENT SAP's new Business Cloud Platform. One of the more interesting news stories in the business systems area this week is that leading distributor of steel, non-ferrous metals and processing services in the Nordics, Tibnor, became first among SAP customers to implement the new SAP Business Data Cloud solution.Why is it big? For several reasons, but perhaps the most important is that this platform represents a landmark as a symbol of where the digitalization wave can lead. A heavy point is the magic that can happen when two leaders in their respective domains, SAP and Databricks, come together to redefine how applications and platforms can work together. The new solution builds Databricks' world-leading technology around data science, machine learning and AI workloads into SAP’s Business Data Cloud platform. This, combined with SAP's expertise in business-critical and comprehensive processes can unleash new levels of values in the context of business data and AI; which Tibnor has now embraced before others:""We have always tried to stay one step ahead in our industry. With SAP Business Data Cloud, new windows opportunities were opened up to quickly integrate with external information, which we could not even imagine a few years ago,"" says Tibnor's Dag Åselius.The investment also fits well into the digitalization efforts that are a central part of Tibnor's business strategy. By investing in standard tools and preparing for a generational change of employees, they have managed to take a position far ahead in the market. After a successful transition to the cloud-based ERP system SAP S/4HANA, they wanted to take another step and be able to connect external data sources.This is not a bad idea for a player like Tibnor. A good example of how you can make better business decisions is the ability to interact in real time with relevant external sources such as, in the case of Tibnor, the London Metal Exchange. As a cloud-based SaaS service, SAP Business Data Cloud can connect to this exchange in real time, which provides excellent opportunities to quickly adapt business decisions to market fluctuations, which are particularly frequent on most types of exchanges and important for the business outcome.“But we have more in our vision of what we can do with the solution,” says Åselius. “One such is to combine all old and new business data in one application and use an AI engine for our pricing. These are complex things because customers are in many different segments such as construction, engineering and the process industry.”But there is more in the planning.

Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Verdi OgewellVerdi Ogewell,,"WORLD PREMIERE: Leading Nordic Steel Supplier TIBNOR Bets Big on SAP’s New Cloud-Based Real-Time PlatformMeet DAG ÅSELIUS, senior IT advisor at Tibnor and former long-time CIO, commenting why the company became FIRST IN THE WORLD to IMPLEMENT SAP's new Business Cloud Platform. One of the more interesting news stories in the business systems area this week is that leading distributor of steel, non-ferrous metals and processing services in the Nordics, Tibnor, became first among SAP customers to implement the new SAP Business Data Cloud solution.Why is it big? For several reasons, but perhaps the most important is that this platform represents a landmark as a symbol of where the digitalization wave can lead. A heavy point is the magic that can happen when two leaders in their respective domains, SAP and Databricks, come together to redefine how applications and platforms can work together. The new solution builds Databricks' world-leading technology around data science, machine learning and AI workloads into SAP’s Business Data Cloud platform. This, combined with SAP's expertise in business-critical and comprehensive processes can unleash new levels of values in the context of business data and AI; which Tibnor has now embraced before others:""We have always tried to stay one step ahead in our industry. With SAP Business Data Cloud, new windows opportunities were opened up to quickly integrate with external information, which we could not even imagine a few years ago,"" says Tibnor's Dag Åselius.The investment also fits well into the digitalization efforts that are a central part of Tibnor's business strategy. By investing in standard tools and preparing for a generational change of employees, they have managed to take a position far ahead in the market. After a successful transition to the cloud-based ERP system SAP S/4HANA, they wanted to take another step and be able to connect external data sources.This is not a bad idea for a player like Tibnor. A good example of how you can make better business decisions is the ability to interact in real time with relevant external sources such as, in the case of Tibnor, the London Metal Exchange. As a cloud-based SaaS service, SAP Business Data Cloud can connect to this exchange in real time, which provides excellent opportunities to quickly adapt business decisions to market fluctuations, which are particularly frequent on most types of exchanges and important for the business outcome.“But we have more in our vision of what we can do with the solution,” says Åselius. “One such is to combine all old and new business data in one application and use an AI engine for our pricing. These are complex things because customers are in many different segments such as construction, engineering and the process industry.”But there is more in the planning.

Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Verdi OgewellVerdi Ogewell,,"WORLD PREMIERE: Leading Nordic Steel Supplier TIBNOR Bets Big on SAP’s New Cloud-Based Real-Time PlatformMeet DAG ÅSELIUS, senior IT advisor at Tibnor and former long-time CIO, commenting why the company became FIRST IN THE WORLD to IMPLEMENT SAP's new Business Cloud Platform. One of the more interesting news stories in the business systems area this week is that leading distributor of steel, non-ferrous metals and processing services in the Nordics, Tibnor, became first among SAP customers to implement the new SAP Business Data Cloud solution.Why is it big? For several reasons, but perhaps the most important is that this platform represents a landmark as a symbol of where the digitalization wave can lead. A heavy point is the magic that can happen when two leaders in their respective domains, SAP and Databricks, come together to redefine how applications and platforms can work together. The new solution builds Databricks' world-leading technology around data science, machine learning and AI workloads into SAP’s Business Data Cloud platform. This, combined with SAP's expertise in business-critical and comprehensive processes can unleash new levels of values in the context of business data and AI; which Tibnor has now embraced before others:""We have always tried to stay one step ahead in our industry. With SAP Business Data Cloud, new windows opportunities were opened up to quickly integrate with external information, which we could not even imagine a few years ago,"" says Tibnor's Dag Åselius.The investment also fits well into the digitalization efforts that are a central part of Tibnor's business strategy. By investing in standard tools and preparing for a generational change of employees, they have managed to take a position far ahead in the market. After a successful transition to the cloud-based ERP system SAP S/4HANA, they wanted to take another step and be able to connect external data sources.This is not a bad idea for a player like Tibnor. A good example of how you can make better business decisions is the ability to interact in real time with relevant external sources such as, in the case of Tibnor, the London Metal Exchange. As a cloud-based SaaS service, SAP Business Data Cloud can connect to this exchange in real time, which provides excellent opportunities to quickly adapt business decisions to market fluctuations, which are particularly frequent on most types of exchanges and important for the business outcome.“But we have more in our vision of what we can do with the solution,” says Åselius. “One such is to combine all old and new business data in one application and use an AI engine for our pricing. These are complex things because customers are in many different segments such as construction, engineering and the process industry.”But there is more in the planning.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Halit ÇELİKHalit ÇELİK,,"DAO Labs ILO Experience: Journey to a Contributively Just EcosystemIn the Web3 world, the number of fair systems where contributions are recognized is limited. However, the ILO (Initial Labor Offering) model developed by DAO Labs is set to change this perception forever. With both transparency and labor-based rewards, this model is not only a token distribution tool, but also a building block for sustainable community building. In this article, I will shed light on DAO Labs' ILO model with my personal experience.📌 Introduction to the Pledge PoolMy involvement as a social miner in DAO Labs' projects played an important role in my selection to the Autonomys Network ILO process. My interaction with the community, the quality of my content production and my previous contributions led to my inclusion in the Pledge Pool. Being included in this pool means that the amount of token allocation you receive will be directly determined by your work output. The higher the quality of the content you produce, the more reward you will receive. This system offers a fair distribution process based on labor and value, beyond traditional airdrops.📌 ILO PhaseBetween March 24 and April 24, 2025, completing tasks spread over four weeks allowed me to get to know Autonomys Network better. Each week, I created content and talked about the project on X (Twitter), Reddit and blogs. By sharing this content with my followers, I made not only the project but also my own experience visible. Sharing a link to a sample piece of content and posting screenshots of the task submission pages on the platform gave the community a genuine and trustworthy impression. The fact that my two-week progress attracted attention in the community motivated me even more.📌 Flexible Vesting and Autonomys HubThe Flexible Vesting model offered by Autonomys Hub has shaped my motivation based on long-term contributions rather than short-term. Some of the tokens I earned were released immediately, while the rest were planned to be released over time. In the process, I not only completed my own tasks, but also contributed to the sustainable growth of the community by mentoring new social miners. Staying active in the vesting process allowed me to take ownership of the project and develop a professional perspective.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

SARMAD WAQASSARMAD WAQAS,,"Why do so many projects stumble despite having skilled contractors on board?The answer often lies not in the contractor’s capabilities — but in the strength of the relationship between the client and contractor.A successful partnership goes beyond contracts and deadlines. It’s built on clarity, trust, and collaboration.Here are four essential pillars to strengthen contractor relationships:1. Clear ScopeDefine the project’s goals, deliverables, and expectations in black and white. A well-defined scope prevents confusion, scope creep, and costly rework.2. Open CommunicationSilence is the enemy of progress. Maintaining frequent updates and fostering honest conversations help resolve issues before they snowball.3. Fair CompensationCompetitive and timely payment isn’t just good ethics — it drives performance, loyalty, and quality delivery. A valued contractor is a motivated contractor.4. Collaborative ApproachTreat contractors as partners, not outsiders.

Gideon EmenikeGideon Emenike,,"The Unbeatable Keys to Winning Contracts - hashtag#ACCURACY & hashtag#COMPLETENESSEver lost a bid and wondered, ""What exactly went wrong?"" 🤔 Here’s the hard truth: Most contracts aren’t lost on pricing or capability alone— they’re lost on overlooked details. A single missing document, an unchecked compliance box, or a vague technical response can disqualify even the strongest bidder. So, how do you ensure your proposal is airtight?Start with the hashtag#Tender_Summary — your blueprint for success. Here are what you MUST nail: ✅ Key Tender Facts – Capture specific instructions peculiar to tender✅ Scope Clarity – Did you hashtag#fully understand the client’s requirements, or did you assume? ✅ Submission Deadlines – Late = automatic disqualification. No exceptions. Create weekly Monitors to keep track of opportunities and deadlines.✅ Technical & Commercial Compliance Checklist – Every document hashtag#must align with client requirements, including its format.✅ Assumptions – Explicitly clarify assumptions to avoid misunderstandings. hashtag#The_Real_Game_Changer?A structured tender review processes —because human error is inevitable, internal stakeholders and bidding team must come together to review tenders after summaries, during TOC checklist ticking and before submission, for maximum compliance.hashtag#Thoughts?

Mubashar KhanMubashar Khan,,"1. OAuth 2.0 (Authorization Framework)Use Case: Third-party app access (e.g., login via Google/Facebook).Steps:1. User Requests Access: A third-party client wants access to user data.2. Redirect to Authorization Server: The client sends the user to the authorization server with client ID and redirect URI.3. User Grants Permission: The user logs in and authorizes the app.4. Authorization Code Returned: The server redirects the user to the client with a temporary code.5. Exchange Code for Token: The client sends the code to the authorization server with client secret to get an access token.6. Access Protected Resources: The client uses the token to call the API.Security Tip: Use PKCE for mobile apps, and always use HTTPS.2. API Key (Basic Authentication)Use Case: Simple, internal or low-risk public APIs.Steps:1. Client Requests Key: The developer registers and receives a unique API key.2. Client Sends Key: Every API request includes this key in the header or query string.3. Server Validates Key: The API server checks the key's validity and grants access if correct.Security Tip: Never expose the API key in client-side code. Rate-limit and monitor usage.3. JWT (JSON Web Token)Use Case: Stateless authentication with user identity and claims embedded.Steps:1. Login with Credentials: User provides credentials to the auth server.2. Token Issued: If correct, a JWT is generated, containing user info, issued time, and expiration.3. Client Stores JWT: Usually in local storage or session.4. Client Sends JWT: In subsequent API calls, the token is added to the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.5. Server Validates: It verifies the token's signature and expiry before granting access.Security Tip: Use short expiration times and refresh tokens for longer sessions.4. Mutual TLS (mTLS)Use Case: High-security environments (banking, internal systems).Steps:1. Client and Server Certificates: Both parties have valid TLS certificates.2. TLS Handshake: During connection, both authenticate using certificates.3. Verify Identity: Server ensures the client is legitimate and vice versa.4. Secure API Communication: Only verified clients can access the API.Security Tip: Use certificate pinning and rotate certificates periodically.

Verdi OgewellVerdi Ogewell,,"WORLD PREMIERE: Leading Nordic Steel Supplier TIBNOR Bets Big on SAP’s New Cloud-Based Real-Time PlatformMeet DAG ÅSELIUS, senior IT advisor at Tibnor and former long-time CIO, commenting why the company became FIRST IN THE WORLD to IMPLEMENT SAP's new Business Cloud Platform. One of the more interesting news stories in the business systems area this week is that leading distributor of steel, non-ferrous metals and processing services in the Nordics, Tibnor, became first among SAP customers to implement the new SAP Business Data Cloud solution.Why is it big? For several reasons, but perhaps the most important is that this platform represents a landmark as a symbol of where the digitalization wave can lead. A heavy point is the magic that can happen when two leaders in their respective domains, SAP and Databricks, come together to redefine how applications and platforms can work together. The new solution builds Databricks' world-leading technology around data science, machine learning and AI workloads into SAP’s Business Data Cloud platform. This, combined with SAP's expertise in business-critical and comprehensive processes can unleash new levels of values in the context of business data and AI; which Tibnor has now embraced before others:""We have always tried to stay one step ahead in our industry. With SAP Business Data Cloud, new windows opportunities were opened up to quickly integrate with external information, which we could not even imagine a few years ago,"" says Tibnor's Dag Åselius.The investment also fits well into the digitalization efforts that are a central part of Tibnor's business strategy. By investing in standard tools and preparing for a generational change of employees, they have managed to take a position far ahead in the market. After a successful transition to the cloud-based ERP system SAP S/4HANA, they wanted to take another step and be able to connect external data sources.This is not a bad idea for a player like Tibnor. A good example of how you can make better business decisions is the ability to interact in real time with relevant external sources such as, in the case of Tibnor, the London Metal Exchange. As a cloud-based SaaS service, SAP Business Data Cloud can connect to this exchange in real time, which provides excellent opportunities to quickly adapt business decisions to market fluctuations, which are particularly frequent on most types of exchanges and important for the business outcome.“But we have more in our vision of what we can do with the solution,” says Åselius. “One such is to combine all old and new business data in one application and use an AI engine for our pricing. These are complex things because customers are in many different segments such as construction, engineering and the process industry.”But there is more in the planning.

Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.
