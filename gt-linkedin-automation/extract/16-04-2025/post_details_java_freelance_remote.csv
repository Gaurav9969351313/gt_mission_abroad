Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected.

Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Igor Ludgero MiuraIgor Ludgero Miura,,"Some time ago I presented at Meet Magento Florida (https://lnkd.in/dCPdVMRQ) an alternative for Magento/Adobe Commerce development environments using GitHub Codespaces.Since then I connected with people asking how to use it, what images they could use, etc. At IM Digital we created our container images which have been maintained and used by our developers for their local environments. But today we decided to make them public so everybody in the Magento community can use them.So we are sharing the images at the repository https://lnkd.in/ddhHAQrN. This repository has the images we can use to configure the development environments.And then the https://lnkd.in/d8AqWS5U repository has an example on how you can set it up for your project with just a few steps. All the documentation is available on the README file.Last but not least I created a fork from the Magento Open Source repository setting up GitHub codespaces so you can also try it before setting it up for one of your projects: https://lnkd.in/dy2jtMvUI hope this helps anyone who struggles with development environment setups, and let me know if you have any questions about it.hashtag#magento hashtag#adobecommerce hashtag#githubcodespaces

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

But today we decided to make them public so everybody in the Magento community can use them.So we are sharing the images at the repository https://lnkd.in/ddhHAQrN. This repository has the images we can use to configure the development environments.And then the https://lnkd.in/d8AqWS5U repository has an example on how you can set it up for your project with just a few steps. All the documentation is available on the README file.Last but not least I created a fork from the Magento Open Source repository setting up GitHub codespaces so you can also try it before setting it up for one of your projects: https://lnkd.in/dy2jtMvUI hope this helps anyone who struggles with development environment setups, and let me know if you have any questions about it.hashtag#magento hashtag#adobecommerce hashtag#githubcodespaces

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Gusttavo BrilhânteGusttavo Brilhânte,,"What I Learned Migrating a Project from Java to KotlinI recently worked on migrating a legacy Android app from Java to Kotlin — and the difference was huge. It wasn't just about productivity, but also code clarity and safety.✨ Key takeaways from the journey:Null safety eliminated several crashes we had been patching for yearsData classes and extension functions massively reduced boilerplateCode readability improved so much it made onboarding new devs easierCoroutines allowed us to rewrite complex callback chains in a much cleaner wayMigration takes effort, but the benefits are real. Kotlin isn’t just “modern syntax” — it’s about long-term productivity and maintainability.👨‍💻 Have you been part of a similar migration?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification. This is a nice collaboration between AVL (including AVL DiTEST) and Mälardalen University in the AIDOaRt project.Co-authors:David Schögler Marjan Sirjani Mikael Sjödin The best thing: it's open access.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Nour TamerNour Tamer,,"يعني إيه Dependency Injection وإزاي بنستخدمه؟الـ Dependency Injection (DI) هو Design Pattern فكرته ببساطة إنك تفصل بين الكلاسات وتقلل الاعتماد المباشر بينهم (tight coupling)، وده بيخلي الكود: أسهل في الصيانة، أسهل في الـ testing، وأكثر مرونة وقابلية للتوسيع.في ASP.NET Core، الـ DI جزء مدموج في الـ Framework نفسه، وده بيسهل علينا نحقن أي خدمة أو repository من غير ما نستخدم new.مثال باستخدام Repository :في مشروع منظم، بنفصل الـ Data Access عن الـ Business Logic باستخدام Repository Pattern، وبنربطهم باستخدام Dependency Injection:١- تسجيل الـ Repository في Program.cs:builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>();builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();--------------------------------------٢- حقن الـ Repository في الـ Service:public class ProductService : IProductService{ private readonly IProductRepository _repo; public ProductService(IProductRepository repo) { _repo = repo; } public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll() { return _repo.GetAll(); }}--------------------------------------٣- حقن الـ Service في الـ Controller:public class ProductController : Controller{ private readonly IProductService _service; public ProductController(IProductService service) { _service = service; } public IActionResult Index() { var products = _service.GetAll(); return View(products); }}إيه الفايدة؟-كل طبقة مستقلة عن التانية (Loose Coupling)-سهل نختبر كل كلاس لوحده-الكود أنضف وأسهل في القراءة والتوسيعأنواع الـ Lifetime في ASP.NET Core:ـ Singleton: نسخة واحدة طول عمر التطبيقـ Scoped: نسخة لكل HTTP requestـ Transient: نسخة جديدة كل مرة بنطلب فيها الخدمة من الأخر، الـ Dependency Injection مش رفاهية، دي طريقة شغل أساسية في أي مشروع ASP.NET Core محترم. هتخلي الكود بتاعك modular، أنضف، وأسهل في الاختبار والتطوير.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#aspnetcore hashtag#dependencyinjection hashtag#repositorypattern hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#CSharp

Use my GPT to convert it to vaadin4.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Mohannad ZahraMohannad Zahra,,"Excited to introduce our OS Scheduler Simulation Project! Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

But today we decided to make them public so everybody in the Magento community can use them.So we are sharing the images at the repository https://lnkd.in/ddhHAQrN.

SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Igor Ludgero MiuraIgor Ludgero Miura,,"Some time ago I presented at Meet Magento Florida (https://lnkd.in/dCPdVMRQ) an alternative for Magento/Adobe Commerce development environments using GitHub Codespaces.Since then I connected with people asking how to use it, what images they could use, etc. At IM Digital we created our container images which have been maintained and used by our developers for their local environments. But today we decided to make them public so everybody in the Magento community can use them.So we are sharing the images at the repository https://lnkd.in/ddhHAQrN. This repository has the images we can use to configure the development environments.And then the https://lnkd.in/d8AqWS5U repository has an example on how you can set it up for your project with just a few steps. All the documentation is available on the README file.Last but not least I created a fork from the Magento Open Source repository setting up GitHub codespaces so you can also try it before setting it up for one of your projects: https://lnkd.in/dy2jtMvUI hope this helps anyone who struggles with development environment setups, and let me know if you have any questions about it.hashtag#magento hashtag#adobecommerce hashtag#githubcodespaces

Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Do not feel sorry for them or any enablers that feel sorry for them as is avoidance of consequences https://lnkd.in/dXmuydrzAvoidance thought https://lnkd.in/dmxipEbGBeing kind to good people is good but being nice to be liked is Not good https://lnkd.in/dU8-GdFqThough is Not gender specific, read https://lnkd.in/ecKRTXrEnablers & avoiders & pleasers & false-nice & fake-good & weak people destroy workplaces & relationships so hurt good-character non-toxic people.hashtag#news hashtag#economy hashtag#ceo hashtag#cfo hashtag#cio

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Eduardo OrdaxEduardo Ordax,,"🚨🚨🚨 MCP server for agents to browse websites with an amazing performance. It's 100% open source and the github repo already has 10K stars!Stagehand allows you to automate browsers with natural language and code. With Stagehand, you can combine AI agents, AI tools, and regular Playwright to customize the agency of your browser automation.Most existing browser automation tools either require you to write low-level code in a framework like Selenium, Playwright, or Puppeteer, or use high-level agents that can be unpredictable in production. By letting developers choose what to write in code vs. natural language, Stagehand is the natural choice for browser automations in production.One MCP server adds five powerful tools:▪️screenshot: Takes a screenshot of the current page▪️stagehand_act: Performs an action on a web page element▪️stagehand_extract: Extracts all of the text from the current page.▪️stagehand_navigate: Navigate to a URL in the browser▪️stagehand_observe: Observes elements on the web page.It allows you to build as complex or as simple browser automations as you want!!Link to the repo in the comments!Like 👍 | Comment 💬 | Repost ♻️ hashtag#ai hashtag#MCP hashtag#genai hashtag#agent

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected.

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

With Stagehand, you can combine AI agents, AI tools, and regular Playwright to customize the agency of your browser automation.Most existing browser automation tools either require you to write low-level code in a framework like Selenium, Playwright, or Puppeteer, or use high-level agents that can be unpredictable in production. By letting developers choose what to write in code vs. natural language, Stagehand is the natural choice for browser automations in production.One MCP server adds five powerful tools:▪️screenshot: Takes a screenshot of the current page▪️stagehand_act: Performs an action on a web page element▪️stagehand_extract: Extracts all of the text from the current page.▪️stagehand_navigate: Navigate to a URL in the browser▪️stagehand_observe: Observes elements on the web page.It allows you to build as complex or as simple browser automations as you want!!Link to the repo in the comments!Like 👍 | Comment 💬 | Repost ♻️ hashtag#ai hashtag#MCP hashtag#genai hashtag#agent

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Eduardo OrdaxEduardo Ordax,,"🚨🚨🚨 MCP server for agents to browse websites with an amazing performance. It's 100% open source and the github repo already has 10K stars!Stagehand allows you to automate browsers with natural language and code. With Stagehand, you can combine AI agents, AI tools, and regular Playwright to customize the agency of your browser automation.Most existing browser automation tools either require you to write low-level code in a framework like Selenium, Playwright, or Puppeteer, or use high-level agents that can be unpredictable in production. By letting developers choose what to write in code vs. natural language, Stagehand is the natural choice for browser automations in production.One MCP server adds five powerful tools:▪️screenshot: Takes a screenshot of the current page▪️stagehand_act: Performs an action on a web page element▪️stagehand_extract: Extracts all of the text from the current page.▪️stagehand_navigate: Navigate to a URL in the browser▪️stagehand_observe: Observes elements on the web page.It allows you to build as complex or as simple browser automations as you want!!Link to the repo in the comments!Like 👍 | Comment 💬 | Repost ♻️ hashtag#ai hashtag#MCP hashtag#genai hashtag#agent

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Mohannad ZahraMohannad Zahra,,"Excited to introduce our OS Scheduler Simulation Project! Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng. Mariam Taha, for her invaluable guidance and support.Check out our work on GitHub and try it out: https://lnkd.in/duU9PvbwDemonstration Video:

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification. This is a nice collaboration between AVL (including AVL DiTEST) and Mälardalen University in the AIDOaRt project.Co-authors:David Schögler Marjan Sirjani Mikael Sjödin The best thing: it's open access.

But today we decided to make them public so everybody in the Magento community can use them.So we are sharing the images at the repository https://lnkd.in/ddhHAQrN.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Nour TamerNour Tamer,,"يعني إيه Dependency Injection وإزاي بنستخدمه؟الـ Dependency Injection (DI) هو Design Pattern فكرته ببساطة إنك تفصل بين الكلاسات وتقلل الاعتماد المباشر بينهم (tight coupling)، وده بيخلي الكود: أسهل في الصيانة، أسهل في الـ testing، وأكثر مرونة وقابلية للتوسيع.في ASP.NET Core، الـ DI جزء مدموج في الـ Framework نفسه، وده بيسهل علينا نحقن أي خدمة أو repository من غير ما نستخدم new.مثال باستخدام Repository :في مشروع منظم، بنفصل الـ Data Access عن الـ Business Logic باستخدام Repository Pattern، وبنربطهم باستخدام Dependency Injection:١- تسجيل الـ Repository في Program.cs:builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>();builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();--------------------------------------٢- حقن الـ Repository في الـ Service:public class ProductService : IProductService{ private readonly IProductRepository _repo; public ProductService(IProductRepository repo) { _repo = repo; } public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll() { return _repo.GetAll(); }}--------------------------------------٣- حقن الـ Service في الـ Controller:public class ProductController : Controller{ private readonly IProductService _service; public ProductController(IProductService service) { _service = service; } public IActionResult Index() { var products = _service.GetAll(); return View(products); }}إيه الفايدة؟-كل طبقة مستقلة عن التانية (Loose Coupling)-سهل نختبر كل كلاس لوحده-الكود أنضف وأسهل في القراءة والتوسيعأنواع الـ Lifetime في ASP.NET Core:ـ Singleton: نسخة واحدة طول عمر التطبيقـ Scoped: نسخة لكل HTTP requestـ Transient: نسخة جديدة كل مرة بنطلب فيها الخدمة من الأخر، الـ Dependency Injection مش رفاهية، دي طريقة شغل أساسية في أي مشروع ASP.NET Core محترم. هتخلي الكود بتاعك modular، أنضف، وأسهل في الاختبار والتطوير.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#aspnetcore hashtag#dependencyinjection hashtag#repositorypattern hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#CSharp

Use my GPT to convert it to vaadin4.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Saves me a TON of time!I used Claude Desktop + Zapier MCP  to wire this up. With Zapier’s 7,000+ app integrations, and 30,000+ actions that you can choose from, building AI-powered automations like this is easier than ever.It took me JUST 7 simple steps to turn Claude into a personal AI assistant, and YEPP can do it too.If you’re curious to try it out, I followed the Claude Desktop + Zapier MCP instructions on Zapier’s site. (Note: it’s an unofficial workaround for now and might not work for everyone.)If you want an official, plug-and-play experience, I’d recommend waiting a couple of weeks for the official connector. Or try it today with Cursor + Zapier MCP, which is officially supported. 💻 Here is a quick tutorial link for both Cursor and Claude integration with Zapier.

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Nour TamerNour Tamer,,"يعني إيه Dependency Injection وإزاي بنستخدمه؟الـ Dependency Injection (DI) هو Design Pattern فكرته ببساطة إنك تفصل بين الكلاسات وتقلل الاعتماد المباشر بينهم (tight coupling)، وده بيخلي الكود: أسهل في الصيانة، أسهل في الـ testing، وأكثر مرونة وقابلية للتوسيع.في ASP.NET Core، الـ DI جزء مدموج في الـ Framework نفسه، وده بيسهل علينا نحقن أي خدمة أو repository من غير ما نستخدم new.مثال باستخدام Repository :في مشروع منظم، بنفصل الـ Data Access عن الـ Business Logic باستخدام Repository Pattern، وبنربطهم باستخدام Dependency Injection:١- تسجيل الـ Repository في Program.cs:builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>();builder.Services.AddScoped<IProductService, ProductService>();--------------------------------------٢- حقن الـ Repository في الـ Service:public class ProductService : IProductService{ private readonly IProductRepository _repo; public ProductService(IProductRepository repo) { _repo = repo; } public IEnumerable<Product> GetAll() { return _repo.GetAll(); }}--------------------------------------٣- حقن الـ Service في الـ Controller:public class ProductController : Controller{ private readonly IProductService _service; public ProductController(IProductService service) { _service = service; } public IActionResult Index() { var products = _service.GetAll(); return View(products); }}إيه الفايدة؟-كل طبقة مستقلة عن التانية (Loose Coupling)-سهل نختبر كل كلاس لوحده-الكود أنضف وأسهل في القراءة والتوسيعأنواع الـ Lifetime في ASP.NET Core:ـ Singleton: نسخة واحدة طول عمر التطبيقـ Scoped: نسخة لكل HTTP requestـ Transient: نسخة جديدة كل مرة بنطلب فيها الخدمة من الأخر، الـ Dependency Injection مش رفاهية، دي طريقة شغل أساسية في أي مشروع ASP.NET Core محترم. هتخلي الكود بتاعك modular، أنضف، وأسهل في الاختبار والتطوير.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#aspnetcore hashtag#dependencyinjection hashtag#repositorypattern hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#CSharp

Use my GPT to convert it to vaadin4.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Saves me a TON of time!I used Claude Desktop + Zapier MCP  to wire this up. With Zapier’s 7,000+ app integrations, and 30,000+ actions that you can choose from, building AI-powered automations like this is easier than ever.It took me JUST 7 simple steps to turn Claude into a personal AI assistant, and YEPP can do it too.If you’re curious to try it out, I followed the Claude Desktop + Zapier MCP instructions on Zapier’s site. (Note: it’s an unofficial workaround for now and might not work for everyone.)If you want an official, plug-and-play experience, I’d recommend waiting a couple of weeks for the official connector. Or try it today with Cursor + Zapier MCP, which is officially supported. 💻 Here is a quick tutorial link for both Cursor and Claude integration with Zapier.

Fatma A.Fatma A.,,"We need 5+ years of experience.But how do we get those 5 years if no one wants to give us our first shot?One of the challenges in Kuwait’s job market—especially in engineering—is the constant demand for senior-level experience, even for roles that could be perfect for junior engineers.This pushes many fresh graduates or early-career engineers to apply for unrelated positions, just to stack up years on a CV. Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Igor Ludgero MiuraIgor Ludgero Miura,,"Some time ago I presented at Meet Magento Florida (https://lnkd.in/dCPdVMRQ) an alternative for Magento/Adobe Commerce development environments using GitHub Codespaces.Since then I connected with people asking how to use it, what images they could use, etc. At IM Digital we created our container images which have been maintained and used by our developers for their local environments. But today we decided to make them public so everybody in the Magento community can use them.So we are sharing the images at the repository https://lnkd.in/ddhHAQrN. This repository has the images we can use to configure the development environments.And then the https://lnkd.in/d8AqWS5U repository has an example on how you can set it up for your project with just a few steps. All the documentation is available on the README file.Last but not least I created a fork from the Magento Open Source repository setting up GitHub codespaces so you can also try it before setting it up for one of your projects: https://lnkd.in/dy2jtMvUI hope this helps anyone who struggles with development environment setups, and let me know if you have any questions about it.hashtag#magento hashtag#adobecommerce hashtag#githubcodespaces

Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Not because they lack skill or ambition—but because they’re never given the chance to prove themselves in the roles they actually want.We talk a lot about “investing in talent” and “developing local capabilities.”Maybe that starts with trusting junior engineers, training them, and giving them the space to grow.Everyone starts somewhere—why not here?The reality? Many of us end up applying for unrelated positions, just to collect “years of experience” and have something to show on a CV.Not because we’re not passionate. Not because we’re not capable.But because the system leaves no other option.I really hope we start shifting this mindset.Talent doesn’t always come with years—it often comes with potential, drive, and a real willingness to learn.As someone eager to grow and contribute, I truly hope more companies start to see potential—not just numbers.hashtag#EngineeringCareers hashtag#KuwaitJobs hashtag#JuniorEngineers hashtag#SupportLocalTalent hashtag#FutureStartsNow hashtag#Engineers hashtag#Kuwait

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes.
