Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity.

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Clear Communication ChannelsWe have streamlined where and how we communicate, reducing noise and ensuring everyone stays in the loop without being overwhelmed.2. Outcome over HoursWe have focused on results, not clock-in times. That shift has driven accountability and autonomy across teams.3.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected.

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Gusttavo BrilhânteGusttavo Brilhânte,,"What I Learned Migrating a Project from Java to KotlinI recently worked on migrating a legacy Android app from Java to Kotlin — and the difference was huge. It wasn't just about productivity, but also code clarity and safety.✨ Key takeaways from the journey:Null safety eliminated several crashes we had been patching for yearsData classes and extension functions massively reduced boilerplateCode readability improved so much it made onboarding new devs easierCoroutines allowed us to rewrite complex callback chains in a much cleaner wayMigration takes effort, but the benefits are real. Kotlin isn’t just “modern syntax” — it’s about long-term productivity and maintainability.👨‍💻 Have you been part of a similar migration?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Gusttavo BrilhânteGusttavo Brilhânte,,"What I Learned Migrating a Project from Java to KotlinI recently worked on migrating a legacy Android app from Java to Kotlin — and the difference was huge. It wasn't just about productivity, but also code clarity and safety.✨ Key takeaways from the journey:Null safety eliminated several crashes we had been patching for yearsData classes and extension functions massively reduced boilerplateCode readability improved so much it made onboarding new devs easierCoroutines allowed us to rewrite complex callback chains in a much cleaner wayMigration takes effort, but the benefits are real. Kotlin isn’t just “modern syntax” — it’s about long-term productivity and maintainability.👨‍💻 Have you been part of a similar migration?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Aleruchi Freerose WalaAleruchi Freerose Wala,,"HOW REMOTE WORK MIGHT BE  IMPACTING YOUR HEALTH.While the world continues to recover from the effects of the hashtag#COVID19 pandemic, one significant shift that has remained is the rise of hashtag#RemoteWork. Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together.

We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification. This is a nice collaboration between AVL (including AVL DiTEST) and Mälardalen University in the AIDOaRt project.Co-authors:David Schögler Marjan Sirjani Mikael Sjödin The best thing: it's open access.

Clear Communication ChannelsWe have streamlined where and how we communicate, reducing noise and ensuring everyone stays in the loop without being overwhelmed.2. Outcome over HoursWe have focused on results, not clock-in times. That shift has driven accountability and autonomy across teams.3. Regular Connection Points From structured check-ins to casual virtual coffee chats, one on one creating space for human connection has been essential.4. Transparent LeadershipBeing means you need to be even more visible as a leader, sharing context, decisions, and even uncertainties builds alignment and trust.It’s not always easy, but it’s definitely worth it.Hybrid work is here to stay, and I believe the future belongs to teams that can adapt with empathy, clarity, and purpose.I would love to hear from others leading hybrid teams — what’s working for you?

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Mohannad ZahraMohannad Zahra,,"Excited to introduce our OS Scheduler Simulation Project! Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Todd AustinTodd Austin,,"I'm glad to point you at a HUGE new release of BRINGUP-BENCH, a benchmark suite for CPU and accelerator development. This new release includes 20 MORE BENCHMARKS, plus significant improvements that now allow Bringup-Bench to run WITHOUT any I/O DEVICES, RUNTIME LIBRARIES, or OPERATING SYSTEMS. You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

Mohannad ZahraMohannad Zahra,,"Excited to introduce our OS Scheduler Simulation Project! Our team—Mohannad Zahra, Abdelrhaman Wael, Omar Alaa, and Ahmed Hassanen—built a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulator using Python and Flask.Key Features:• Process Generator Module: Generates structured process data with a normal distribution to simulate realistic scenarios. Arrival times and burst times are crafted based on specified means and standard deviations. A custom algorithm fine-tunes the final process to ensure the generated values align with our targeted statistical parameters.• Scheduling Algorithms: Implements four distinct algorithms—FCFS, SRTF, Priority, and Round Robin—with in-depth computations for turnaround, waiting, and response times.• Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes Matplotlib to create intuitive bar charts (illustrating average turnaround, waiting, and response times) and Gantt charts that map out the execution timeline of each algorithm.Mohannad Zahra led back-end development, front-end integration, and project management to keep everything on track. Abdelrhaman Wael delivered an exceptional website design with dynamic animations, while Omar Alaa and Ahmed Hassanen reinforced our back end with robust algorithm implementations, comprehensive error handling, and rigorous testing to ensure reliability.A special thank you to our TA, Eng.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

It wasn't just about productivity, but also code clarity and safety.✨ Key takeaways from the journey:Null safety eliminated several crashes we had been patching for yearsData classes and extension functions massively reduced boilerplateCode readability improved so much it made onboarding new devs easierCoroutines allowed us to rewrite complex callback chains in a much cleaner wayMigration takes effort, but the benefits are real. Kotlin isn’t just “modern syntax” — it’s about long-term productivity and maintainability.👨‍💻 Have you been part of a similar migration?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Clear Communication ChannelsWe have streamlined where and how we communicate, reducing noise and ensuring everyone stays in the loop without being overwhelmed.2. Outcome over HoursWe have focused on results, not clock-in times. That shift has driven accountability and autonomy across teams.3. Regular Connection Points From structured check-ins to casual virtual coffee chats, one on one creating space for human connection has been essential.4. Transparent LeadershipBeing means you need to be even more visible as a leader, sharing context, decisions, and even uncertainties builds alignment and trust.It’s not always easy, but it’s definitely worth it.Hybrid work is here to stay, and I believe the future belongs to teams that can adapt with empathy, clarity, and purpose.I would love to hear from others leading hybrid teams — what’s working for you?

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

"Félix Socorro, P.Félix Socorro, P.",,"hashtag#QuestionForGroupRecruiters should not dismiss a candidate solely because they prefer remote work, as this model has proven to be just as productive—if not more so—than office-based work in many cases. Recent studies and experiences indicate that remote employees often have greater flexibility in managing their time, which can lead to improved efficiency and job satisfaction. Additionally, remote work allows access to diverse and highly skilled talent without geographical restrictions, enriching teams and fostering innovation.Another key point is that the demand for remote work has grown significantly, and rejecting a candidate for this reason could limit a company’s ability to attract and retain top professionals. Many candidates value flexibility as a fundamental benefit, and firms that fail to offer it may fall behind in a competitive job market. Moreover, adopting flexible policies enhances an organisation’s image as modern and attuned to current needs, strengthening its employer brand.Lately, I’ve noticed candidates being asked whether they would turn down a job offer if it were 100% office-based, so I’ve decided to pose the same question from the candidate’s perspective. I wonder what the responses will be.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

You can check out the new release here: https://lnkd.in/gfW889FsHere is what is in the new release (version 1.6):* 20 new benchmarks added, now for a total of 85 benchmarks!* TARGETs can now exclude benchmarks from their tests by adding them to TARGET_EXCLUDES in the Makefile* more benchmarks are now working on more targets* the SPIKE reference target now supports 8 MB memory* HASHALONE targets now are self-checking* the QSORT library implementation is now much more robust* an FP libmin_printf() problem was fixed, and it affected some benchmark outputs (which have been corrected)* the SPIKE and SIMPLE targets are now completely separated​What is Bringup-bench? The Bringup-bench benchmark suite is a collection of 85 standalone C benchmarks designed to assist in the initial testing and validation of CPUs and accelerators. The suite is built to be easily hosted on simulated or real CPU platforms with no I/O devices, runtime libraries, or operating systems.​ Running Bringup-bench, it is possible to perform deep functional testing of your design and early performance analysis. The benchmarks have modest runtimes; for example, running Bringup-bench on the IBEX RISC-V CPU RTL with Verilator, the entire benchmark suite completes execution in under 30 minutes.If you have found these benchmarks useful, please share your experience in the comments below. I see a lot of activity on the repo, so I would love to learn more about how Bringup-bench is being used.hashtag#computerarchitecture hashtag#hardware hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#CPU hashtag#RISCV hashtag#benchmarking hashtag#verification hashtag#validation

Aleruchi Freerose WalaAleruchi Freerose Wala,,"HOW REMOTE WORK MIGHT BE  IMPACTING YOUR HEALTH.While the world continues to recover from the effects of the hashtag#COVID19 pandemic, one significant shift that has remained is the rise of hashtag#RemoteWork. Though flexible work arrangements offer convenience, they also come with subtle health risks that may go unnoticed.Here are three ways remote work could be affecting your health—plus simple tips to stay well:↪️1. Increased Sedentary LifestyleSpending long hours indoors and at your desk can drastically reduce your daily movement, increasing the risk of chronic conditions such as hashtag#obesity, hashtag#hypertension, and hashtag#diabetesmellitus.🚩Tip: Be intentional about integrating movement into your routine—try activities like skipping, spot jogging, or short home workouts.↪️2. Reduced Exposure to Sunlight.Limited outdoor time can reduce your body’s natural activation of **Vitamin D and calcium**, both crucial for healthy bones.Tip: Step outside for a few minutes of morning sunlight daily—preferably before 11 a.m.↪️3. Social Isolation & Mood SwingsWithout in-person interactions, remote workers can experience loneliness, mood changes, and a decline in mental well-being especially those without close family support at home.🚩Tip: Stay socially connected. Schedule video calls with friends, have meaningful conversations, or spend quality time with loved ones in person when possible.I hope this helps you stay more aware and intentional about your health while working remotely.Have you experienced any other health changes since switching to remote work?

Stefan MarksteinerStefan Marksteiner,,"Check out our newest hashtag#research in the Springer Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer (hashtag#STTT). We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

"Félix Socorro, P.Félix Socorro, P.",,"hashtag#QuestionForGroupRecruiters should not dismiss a candidate solely because they prefer remote work, as this model has proven to be just as productive—if not more so—than office-based work in many cases. Recent studies and experiences indicate that remote employees often have greater flexibility in managing their time, which can lead to improved efficiency and job satisfaction. Additionally, remote work allows access to diverse and highly skilled talent without geographical restrictions, enriching teams and fostering innovation.Another key point is that the demand for remote work has grown significantly, and rejecting a candidate for this reason could limit a company’s ability to attract and retain top professionals. Many candidates value flexibility as a fundamental benefit, and firms that fail to offer it may fall behind in a competitive job market. Moreover, adopting flexible policies enhances an organisation’s image as modern and attuned to current needs, strengthening its employer brand.Lately, I’ve noticed candidates being asked whether they would turn down a job offer if it were 100% office-based, so I’ve decided to pose the same question from the candidate’s perspective. I wonder what the responses will be.

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects? Let’s discuss!hashtag#Java21 hashtag#Go hashtag#Concurrency hashtag#VirtualThreads hashtag#Goroutines hashtag#Programming hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#Threading

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all. We show this on a Tesla key with both its BLE and NFC interfaces. Besides, we demonstrate a rigorous and comprehensive method for checking systems' compliance to a specification.

Damilola OyeyemiDamilola Oyeyemi,,"Leading Hybrid Teams: My Experience as a  COONavigating leadership in a hybrid world has been one of the most rewarding and challenging aspects of my role as COO.Managing teams spread across time zones and work environments requires more than just digital tools,  it demands intentional communication, trust, and flexibility.Here are a few strategies that have helped us stay connected and productive:1. Clear Communication ChannelsWe have streamlined where and how we communicate, reducing noise and ensuring everyone stays in the loop without being overwhelmed.2. Outcome over HoursWe have focused on results, not clock-in times. That shift has driven accountability and autonomy across teams.3. Regular Connection Points From structured check-ins to casual virtual coffee chats, one on one creating space for human connection has been essential.4. Transparent LeadershipBeing means you need to be even more visible as a leader, sharing context, decisions, and even uncertainties builds alignment and trust.It’s not always easy, but it’s definitely worth it.Hybrid work is here to stay, and I believe the future belongs to teams that can adapt with empathy, clarity, and purpose.I would love to hear from others leading hybrid teams — what’s working for you?

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management?

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

Do not feel sorry for them or any enablers that feel sorry for them as is avoidance of consequences https://lnkd.in/dXmuydrzAvoidance thought https://lnkd.in/dmxipEbGBeing kind to good people is good but being nice to be liked is Not good https://lnkd.in/dU8-GdFqThough is Not gender specific, read https://lnkd.in/ecKRTXrEnablers & avoiders & pleasers & false-nice & fake-good & weak people destroy workplaces & relationships so hurt good-character non-toxic people.hashtag#news hashtag#economy hashtag#ceo hashtag#cfo hashtag#cio

Tom HanneliusTom Hannelius,,"The best views at bauma were served by Bronto Skylift!Some thoughts from walking the grounds of the world's largest heavy machinery trade fair, and my vantage point at 98 meters.User experience is paramount. And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast.

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

"Félix Socorro, P.Félix Socorro, P.",,"hashtag#QuestionForGroupRecruiters should not dismiss a candidate solely because they prefer remote work, as this model has proven to be just as productive—if not more so—than office-based work in many cases. Recent studies and experiences indicate that remote employees often have greater flexibility in managing their time, which can lead to improved efficiency and job satisfaction. Additionally, remote work allows access to diverse and highly skilled talent without geographical restrictions, enriching teams and fostering innovation.Another key point is that the demand for remote work has grown significantly, and rejecting a candidate for this reason could limit a company’s ability to attract and retain top professionals. Many candidates value flexibility as a fundamental benefit, and firms that fail to offer it may fall behind in a competitive job market. Moreover, adopting flexible policies enhances an organisation’s image as modern and attuned to current needs, strengthening its employer brand.Lately, I’ve noticed candidates being asked whether they would turn down a job offer if it were 100% office-based, so I’ve decided to pose the same question from the candidate’s perspective. I wonder what the responses will be.

Smruti pawarSmruti pawar,,"The Rise of Hybrid Work Culture: Challenges and InnovationsIntroductionIn the wake of the global pandemic, the traditional concept of the workplace has undergone a seismic shift. One of the most prominent trends emerging in the HR world today is the hybrid work model — a blend of in-office and remote work. This shift is not just a temporary response; it’s redefining the future of work. As companies adapt to this model, HR professionals are at the forefront, navigating its challenges and shaping innovative strategies to support it effectively.The hybrid model offers flexibility, boosts employee satisfaction, and helps organizations tap into a wider talent pool. However, it also brings along complex challenges:-Communication Barriers: With team members working from different locations, maintaining seamless communication can be difficult. Organizations need to invest in collaborative tools and set clear communication protocols.-Employee Engagement: Keeping remote employees engaged and connected with company culture is a growing concern. Virtual team-building activities and regular check-ins are essential.-Performance Management: Evaluating performance remotely requires HR to move beyond traditional metrics. Emphasis on outcome-based assessment, regular feedback, and goal alignment is key.-Work-Life Balance: While hybrid work offers flexibility, it can blur the lines between personal and professional life. HR must advocate for mental health support and work boundaries.Innovative ResponsesForward-thinking HR departments are leveraging technology to overcome these challenges. AI-based HR tools now assist with recruitment, onboarding, and employee sentiment analysis. ConclusionThe hybrid work culture is here to stay, and HR plays a critical role in making it successful. By embracing innovation, addressing challenges proactively, and staying employee-centric, HR can lead the way toward a more agile and resilient future of work.hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#HRTrends hashtag#MESIMCC hashtag#MBA

Muhammad SuhailMuhammad Suhail,,"The Real Problem with Hybrid Work?The real problem with hybrid work isn’t just about people working from different locations it’s about disconnection. Not just from the office, but from each other, from culture, and from a shared sense of purpose.Here are a few core issues behind the curtain:1. Unequal ExperiencesIn hybrid setups, some are in the room, others are in a Zoom. That physical divide can create information gaps, subtle exclusion, and even career disadvantages. Those in-office might get more facetime with leadership, while remote folks risk being overlooked.2. Culture DilutionCulture used to be coffee chats, spontaneous whiteboard moments, and hallway banter. In a hybrid world, it's harder to maintain those rituals. Culture becomes a Slack channel and that’s not enough.3. Managerial StrainLeaders are being asked to do more: build culture, ensure productivity, monitor well-being, and keep everyone engaged now spread across time zones and locations. Many haven’t been trained to lead in this new paradigm.4. Trust & Visibility ConfusionSome leaders still associate presence with productivity. Remote employees might overcompensate with constant online presence leading to burnout while still being met with skepticism.5. Belonging and ConnectionHumans crave connection. Remote workers often report feeling lonely, less heard, or out of the loop  especially if communication isn’t intentional and inclusive.So what’s the fix?Intentional communication. Don’t rely on chance interactions  design meaningful touchpoints.Redefine productivity. Focus on output, not hours.Rebuild rituals. Find new ways to connect hybrid-friendly ones.Train leaders. Equip them to lead inclusively, regardless of location.Trust your people. Autonomy and accountability go hand in hand.Hybrid work isn’t broken it’s just unfinished. It’s not about forcing people back into office chairs. It’s about designing work that works for humans wherever they are.

Jonas SilveiraJonas Silveira,,"🚀 Concurrency Battle: Java 21 Virtual Threads vs. Go GoroutinesConcurrency plays a crucial role in performance and scalability — and the way programming languages handle threads can make all the difference. Today, we’re comparing two powerful approaches: Java 21’s Virtual Threads and Go’s Goroutines.☕ Java 21: The Rise of Virtual ThreadsJava 21 introduces Virtual Threads, a major step forward in simplifying concurrent programming.🔹 Traditional Threading: Previously, Java required careful synchronization with synchronized blocks, ReentrantLock, and thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap, leading to complex and error-prone code.🔹 Virtual Threads: The JVM manages these lightweight threads, allowing developers to write straightforward, blocking-style code without worrying about the performance penalties of OS threads. In many cases, they dramatically reduce the need for explicit synchronization.🐿 Go: Built for ConcurrencyGo was designed with concurrency at its core. Its lightweight Goroutines and channel-based communication model make concurrent programming clean and powerful.🔹 Goroutines: Cheap to spawn and managed by the Go runtime scheduler, they enable massive concurrency with minimal overhead.🔹 Channels: Go’s idiomatic way to coordinate goroutines — allowing communication to replace shared memory and locks in most cases.🗝 Key Differences• Synchronization: Java uses thread-safe constructs; Go favors communication via channels. • Complexity: Go is simpler out of the box. Java has improved significantly with Virtual Threads. • Runtime Management: Both models are managed by their respective runtimes, enabling lightweight concurrency. • Maturity: Go’s model is well-established. Java’s Virtual Threads are newer but promising.✅ In ConclusionJava 21’s Virtual Threads are a big leap, offering a concurrency model closer to Go’s simplicity. While Go remains a go-to for clean concurrent code, Java developers now have modern tools to write scalable, readable, and efficient concurrent applications.💬 How have Virtual Threads or Goroutines shaped your projects?

We can now, fully automated, generate (learn) digital counterparts (state machines) of multiple communication protocols running on the same device using automata learning. The novelty is that we can really learn one single model at once, instead of generating one model for each protocol and trying to join them together. The rationale is that the protocols may influence each other (the whole is more than the sum of its parts) and therefore this should lead to more realistic models to analyze hashtag#security and hashtag#correctness - modern devices usually have more than one interface, after all.

Karan PatelKaran Patel,,"Centralizing Singleton Management with SingletonFactory in Plain Java 8! 🚀In modular applications, managing multiple singletons can become messy with scattered static initializers and nested holders. The SingletonFactory approach centralizes creation, reduces boilerplate, and enables flexible, lazy initialization. Here's a quick look:Comparison at a Glance:Boilerplate: Traditional: Scattered static initializers/holders. SingletonFactory: Centralized & minimal code. ✨Initialization: Traditional: Eager or complex lazy holders with less control and of single type object. SingletonFactory: Lazy via computeIfAbsent + Supplier. ⏱️Flexibility: Traditional: One instance per class. SingletonFactory: Supports multiple types (e.g., Foo, Biz) in one registry—can even hold singletons of different classes in a single factory! 🔀In short:For simple global instances like a logger, the classic singleton works fine. But for modular systems needing several singletons, a centralized factory reduces clutter, offers granular control, and boosts scalability—all in plain old Java 8 with no extra frameworks! Simply amazing ! 🌟 🧠 Highlights:💡 Plain Java 8 – no frameworks, no annotations.🔑 Key-based mapping – plus support for multiple instances of same class (e.g., ""user1"", ""user2"").🧵 Thread-safe – uses ConcurrentHashMap.🧽 No boilerplate – just register + get.🔁 Centralized, Modular & Reusable – can be dropped into any project.What’s your experience with singleton management? Let’s discuss! 💬🔍

Using simple components like nRF24L01 and Arduino, I was able to capture the wireless signals sent from a mouse to a computer and inject malicious commands (like opening applications or typing commands) without the user noticing.💡 I actually saw a similar concept demonstrated at Black Hat MEA 2023 — one of the many benefits of attending cybersecurity conferences!🚗 Car Remote Replay via Phone In this project, I used Arduino and RF modules to capture the signal sent by a car remote (usually at 433 MHz or 315 MHz). I then analyzed and stored the signal, and successfully replayed it using my smartphone through a simple app connected to the module via Bluetooth.✅ This allowed the phone to act as a clone of the car remote.This project also opens the door to bigger ideas — with a bit of development, it’s possible to capture the signal from any older car (typically models before 2015) and replay it without needing the original remote 🙃😂❓Why doesn’t it work on newer cars? Because they use something called rolling codes — which are more secure — although there are some theoretical bypass methods, they're not really practical.

And I’m not just talking about smooth, cool-looking HMIs. The full package of mechanics, hydraulics, electronics, and software must work seamlessly together. Plus, you’ve got to be able to blast Rammstein in a well AC'd cabin with top-notch ergonomics.We software developers are proud of our advanced user interfaces, and rightly so. But let’s not forget: beautiful design alone won’t move tonnes, drill meters, level slopes, or maximize yield. Productivity, reliability, durability, precision, and safety are what define the real value of heavy machinery applications. The software we craft must serve these goals.As machines become increasingly connected, cybersecurity becomes mission-critical. Fleet management, remote operation, over-the-air updates, and site-wide system integration are the norm. You need to know exactly what’s being installed, who’s connecting, and can the data flowing into your system be trusted. A robust end-to-end cybersecurity architecture is essential, and secure development practices must be embedded throughout the entire product lifecycle.It was refreshing to see that the AI hype was nowhere to be seen. Interesting things are brewing in the background though. Drivers for machine learning lie in situational awareness, intelligent maintenance, performance optimization, and (go figure) improving overall user experience.This was my first time at Messe München, and I was genuinely impressed by the venue. Especially when taking in the view from the bucket of the S104HLA aerial platform. I’m blown away by how well Bronto's engineers have balanced that beast. Thanks to Tommi Ekman for hooking me up with a ride!hashtag#bauma hashtag#design hashtag#userexperience hashtag#ai hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#cybersecurity

Venkata kishore YerramsettiVenkata kishore Yerramsetti,,"hashtag#LearnJava - Day 12: Java Type Casting – Widening and NarrowingToday let’s explore Type Casting in Java, a crucial concept when dealing with different data types.1. Widening (Automatic / Implicit Conversion):Widening is the process where a smaller data type is automatically converted into a larger data type. It is safe and does not require explicit casting.Example:int a = 10;long b = a;    // int to longfloat c = b;   // long to floatThis is also called auto type promotion. It goes in this order:byte → short → int → long → float → double2. Narrowing (Manual / Explicit Conversion):Narrowing is converting a larger data type into a smaller one. It’s not safe, so Java requires you to explicitly cast the value.Example:double x = 10.5;int y = (int) x; // double to int, value becomes 10Narrowing follows the reverse order:double → float → long → int → short → byteThe image below clearly illustrates the flow of Widening (left to right) and Narrowing (right to left).Use widening when precision/data loss isn’t a concern, and narrowing carefully when you know the risk of losing data.

Ivan VoloshynIvan Voloshyn,,"ReDrive App Update 🚀Bugs, Bugs, and More Bugs 🙃It took me a bit longer than expected to implement the main feature of my app—Logs. I originally built it in just a few hours, but the real challenge began when I started testing the app. There were plenty of bugs (and hopefully a few more down the road), so I spent almost the entire weekend—around 14–16 hours—fixing everything while squeezing this in after my main job.One specific issue took most of my time: a race condition (asynchronous synchronization issue). I use Firebase Auth with an AuthStateListener to monitor the sign-in status across the app. I was also relying on this listener to save the user’s UID into DataStore and create a new User in the Room database.After a successful user creation, the AuthStateListener would immediately notify that we were signed in. In DataStore, the UID was saved, and in Room, the new User was created—but without the display name,even though I had updated the display name in Firebase, as you can see:override suspend fun signUpWithEmail(credentials: FbUserAuthCredentials): FirebaseUser { val result = auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(credentials.email, credentials.password) .await() result.user?.updateProfile( UserProfileChangeRequest.Builder().setDisplayName(credentials.fullName).build() )?.await() // Here, some less important code... 😁 } It took me several hours to realize that the issue was in the AuthStateListener: it didn’t wait for the user data update (i.e., the display name) before notifying that the sign-in was complete.To fix this, I moved the code responsible for saving the user into Room directly into the signUp function, rather than relying on the AuthStateListener. Now it works as expected, as you can see in the video below.For now, it's time to implement the Stats feature, perform some code refactoring for greater clarity, and enhance the UI/UX for a smoother experience. Version 1.0 will be ready soon. Stay tuned! 🚀hashtag#ReDrivehashtag#Androidhashtag#Kotlinhashtag#CleanArchitecture

Wasim MateenWasim Mateen,,"Yes sir! The current standard is Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery packs—what most EVs today use (like your MG4). So a side-by-side comparison of Li-ion vs. ARO’s version of SSB is an awesome idea. Here’s a rough breakdown we can refine together:---ARO Tech Breakdown: SSB vs. Li-ion---ARO’s SSBs aren’t just upgrades—they redefine how energy is stored, cooled, swapped, and charged.So let’s go wild with our own version of what SSB battery integration looks like for ARO trucks and buses:---ARO SSB Battery System — Codename: “CORE-FLEX”1. Modular, Lightweight Cell Blocks:Each SSB unit is about the size of a small suitcase—carbon composite casing, heat-resistant, ultra-thin. Can be carried and replaced by two people if needed.2. Flexible Underfloor Battery Rail (FUBR):ARO trucks and buses use a multi-rail energy spine under the floor. SSB units slide in from the side like server blades into a data rack.3. AI-Synced Mounting:As the SSB slides in, smart magnetic locks pull it into place, while an AI system checks alignment, power balance, and thermal interfaces. You’ll hear a satisfying “click” and soft hum as it connects.4. Cooling & Safety:Each module has phase-changing gel packs and microchannel liquid cooling, monitored by a local AI chip. If one cell fails, it isolates itself instantly—no domino failures, no fire risks.5. Charging Interface:Dual-port input with solid-state handshake verification—this means chargers and batteries talk before any current flows. Prevents overcharging or foreign device mismatch.6. Swapping Possibility (Optional):Fleet versions (buses/trucks) have quick-release hatches, allowing a robotic arm or technician to swap a dead battery in 4 minutes. Great for long-haul or airport usage.

"Félix Socorro, P.Félix Socorro, P.",,"hashtag#QuestionForGroupRecruiters should not dismiss a candidate solely because they prefer remote work, as this model has proven to be just as productive—if not more so—than office-based work in many cases. Recent studies and experiences indicate that remote employees often have greater flexibility in managing their time, which can lead to improved efficiency and job satisfaction. Additionally, remote work allows access to diverse and highly skilled talent without geographical restrictions, enriching teams and fostering innovation.Another key point is that the demand for remote work has grown significantly, and rejecting a candidate for this reason could limit a company’s ability to attract and retain top professionals. Many candidates value flexibility as a fundamental benefit, and firms that fail to offer it may fall behind in a competitive job market. Moreover, adopting flexible policies enhances an organisation’s image as modern and attuned to current needs, strengthening its employer brand.Lately, I’ve noticed candidates being asked whether they would turn down a job offer if it were 100% office-based, so I’ve decided to pose the same question from the candidate’s perspective.

Stuti GuptaStuti Gupta,,"I used to think ""push"" and ""pop"" were loyal to DSA...But turns out they’ve signed full-time contracts with TOC and Microprocessors too. 🥲First, it was DSA - ""Push, Pop, Stack Overflow, Underflow""... okay, I got it.Then came TOC's Pushdown Automata : Suddenly, the stack is deciding the fate of languages like it's the CEO of Computation. 💻And now? Microprocessor 8085 enters the chat : ""Let's talk about CALL, RET, PUSH, POP instructions again!"" Bruh... how many stacks do we need? 💀Moral of the story : Stack is not just a data structure. It’s a lifestyle. And I... am clearly living in it. 😭📚hashtag#TechLife hashtag#StudentStruggles hashtag#StackAttack hashtag#DSA hashtag#TOC hashtag#Microprocessors #8085 hashtag#EngineeringHumour hashtag#CodingLife

Sahil TiwariSahil Tiwari,,"🚀 Day 151 of hashtag#GFG160 – Bellman-Ford Algorithm 🔁📉We’re deep into graph algorithms now! Today’s problem is the legendary Bellman-Ford algorithm, perfect for handling graphs with negative weights and detecting negative weight cycles ⚠️.🧠 Problem Summary:Given a directed weighted graph with V vertices and E edges, compute the shortest distance from a source node source to all other vertices.If a node is unreachable → mark it as 1e8If a negative weight cycle exists → return [-1]🔄 Bellman-Ford Overview:Works for graphs with negative weightsRelaxes all edges V-1 timesAfter V-1 iterations, we check one more time:If any distance still reduces → there’s a negative weight cycle🧩 Steps to Solve:Initialize dist[] of size V with 1e8, set dist[src] = 0Relax all edges V-1 times:if (dist[u] + w < dist[v]) dist[v] = dist[u] + w;Check for negative weight cycle:If relaxation still happens → return {-1}Return the final distance array⏱️ Time & Space Complexity:Time: O(V × E)Space: O(V) for dist[]🧪 Example 1:V = 5edges = { {1, 3, 2}, {4, 3, -1}, {2, 4, 1}, {1, 2, 1}, {0, 1, 5}}src = 0📤 Output: [0, 5, 6, 6, 7] 📌 Path: 0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 3⚠️ Example 2 (Negative Cycle):V = 4edges = { {0, 1, 4}, {1, 2, -6}, {2, 3, 5}, {3, 1, -2}}src = 0📤 Output: [-1] 📌 Because the cycle 1 → 2 → 3 → 1 has negative weight.🧠 Concepts Covered:Bellman-Ford AlgorithmSingle Source Shortest Path (SSSP)Negative Weight Cycle DetectionEdge Relaxation🌟 Final Thoughts:Bellman-Ford is a must-have tool in your graph theory arsenal, especially when Dijkstra fails due to negative weights. Loved the logic and simplicity behind its power 💪 GeeksforGeeks hashtag#gfg160hashtag#BellmanFord hashtag#GraphAlgorithms hashtag#ShortestPath hashtag#GFG160 hashtag#DSA151 hashtag#NegativeCycle

Smruti pawarSmruti pawar,,"The Rise of Hybrid Work Culture: Challenges and InnovationsIntroductionIn the wake of the global pandemic, the traditional concept of the workplace has undergone a seismic shift. One of the most prominent trends emerging in the HR world today is the hybrid work model — a blend of in-office and remote work. This shift is not just a temporary response; it’s redefining the future of work. As companies adapt to this model, HR professionals are at the forefront, navigating its challenges and shaping innovative strategies to support it effectively.The hybrid model offers flexibility, boosts employee satisfaction, and helps organizations tap into a wider talent pool. However, it also brings along complex challenges:-Communication Barriers: With team members working from different locations, maintaining seamless communication can be difficult. Organizations need to invest in collaborative tools and set clear communication protocols.-Employee Engagement: Keeping remote employees engaged and connected with company culture is a growing concern. Virtual team-building activities and regular check-ins are essential.-Performance Management: Evaluating performance remotely requires HR to move beyond traditional metrics. Emphasis on outcome-based assessment, regular feedback, and goal alignment is key.-Work-Life Balance: While hybrid work offers flexibility, it can blur the lines between personal and professional life. HR must advocate for mental health support and work boundaries.Innovative ResponsesForward-thinking HR departments are leveraging technology to overcome these challenges. AI-based HR tools now assist with recruitment, onboarding, and employee sentiment analysis. ConclusionThe hybrid work culture is here to stay, and HR plays a critical role in making it successful. By embracing innovation, addressing challenges proactively, and staying employee-centric, HR can lead the way toward a more agile and resilient future of work.hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#HRTrends hashtag#MESIMCC hashtag#MBA
