Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast.

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast.

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Paula CintioniPaula Cintioni,,"We don’t usually share our results, but given the current climate, this quarter felt different.👉 Because what happened in these first months of 2025 speaks not only to where our industry is heading—but also to how we choose to navigate uncertainty at CIMA.While the landscape remains challenging, one thing hasn’t changed:The need to keep building with talent. And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast. Sometimes, it’s about growing steady.We’ll keep learning and sharing. Always from the field. 💜→ 🧠 AI helped me bring this surreal image to life: a Latin American woman exploring the wild jungle of tech—wires, hardware, and all.hashtag#HiringInLATAM hashtag#TechRecruitment hashtag#EcommerceTalent hashtag#DataScienceCareers hashtag#MachineLearningJobs hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#RemoteHiring hashtag#GlobalHiring

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast.

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Paula CintioniPaula Cintioni,,"We don’t usually share our results, but given the current climate, this quarter felt different.👉 Because what happened in these first months of 2025 speaks not only to where our industry is heading—but also to how we choose to navigate uncertainty at CIMA.While the landscape remains challenging, one thing hasn’t changed:The need to keep building with talent. And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast. Sometimes, it’s about growing steady.We’ll keep learning and sharing. Always from the field. 💜→ 🧠 AI helped me bring this surreal image to life: a Latin American woman exploring the wild jungle of tech—wires, hardware, and all.hashtag#HiringInLATAM hashtag#TechRecruitment hashtag#EcommerceTalent hashtag#DataScienceCareers hashtag#MachineLearningJobs hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#RemoteHiring hashtag#GlobalHiring

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast.

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast.

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast.

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

Paula CintioniPaula Cintioni,,"We don’t usually share our results, but given the current climate, this quarter felt different.👉 Because what happened in these first months of 2025 speaks not only to where our industry is heading—but also to how we choose to navigate uncertainty at CIMA.While the landscape remains challenging, one thing hasn’t changed:The need to keep building with talent. And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast. Sometimes, it’s about growing steady.We’ll keep learning and sharing. Always from the field. 💜→ 🧠 AI helped me bring this surreal image to life: a Latin American woman exploring the wild jungle of tech—wires, hardware, and all.hashtag#HiringInLATAM hashtag#TechRecruitment hashtag#EcommerceTalent hashtag#DataScienceCareers hashtag#MachineLearningJobs hashtag#StartupGrowth hashtag#RemoteHiring hashtag#GlobalHiring

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast.

But your words, your support, and the way you believed in me made that transition even more meaningful. You made me feel like I belonged there from day one.Your daily “Hi champ” always brought a smile simple words, but they meant a lot. That was just you: thoughtful, genuine, and full of quiet encouragement.You’re someone who’s not just respected, but truly loved by everyone around you.Thank you for everything. Truely 🙏Haytham Salama

Osama AhmedOsama Ahmed,,"🔍 الفرق بين IEnumerable و IQueryable في hashtag#CSharp و hashtag#LINQفي عالم البرمجة باستخدام hashtag#LINQ في hashtag#CSharp، بنقابل واجهتين أساسيتين للتعامل مع البيانات: IEnumerable و IQueryable. وعلى الرغم إن الاتنين بيخدموا نفس الهدف وهو استرجاع البيانات، إلا إن كل واحدة منهم ليها سلوك مختلف تمامًا في طريقة التعامل مع مصدر البيانات.✅ ما هو IEnumerable؟IEnumerable هو Interface يُستخدم للتعامل مع البيانات الموجودة بالفعل في الذاكرة (In-Memory).تقدر تستخدمه مع مجموعات بيانات زي List, Array, أو أي Collection تاني.لما تستخدم LINQ مع IEnumerable على مصدر خارجي (زي قاعدة بيانات)، البيانات كلها بتتجاب الأول وتحط في الذاكرة، وبعدين يتم تنفيذ عمليات الفلترة والتعديل عليها داخل التطبيق نفسه.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:يعتمد على Deferred Execution، يعني:الاستعلام بيتكتب، بس مش بيتنفذ فورًا.بيتنفذ بس أول ما تبدأ تستخدم النتيجة فعلًا (زي foreach, .ToList()).❗ العيوب:تحميل كل البيانات للذاكرة ممكن يكون مكلف في الأداء، خصوصًا لو حجم البيانات كبير.✅ ما هو IQueryable؟IQueryable هو Interface مصمم للتعامل مع مصادر البيانات الخارجية زي قواعد البيانات باستخدام ORMs زي Entity Framework.يسمح بتحويل استعلام LINQ إلى SQL Query حقيقي يتنفذ على السيرفر مباشرة.بيسمح بعمليات الفلترة والتجميع وغيرها إنها تتم داخل الـ Database، مش على التطبيق.⚙️ تنفيذ الاستعلام:برضه بيستخدم Deferred Execution، بس الفرق إنه بيرسل الاستعلام كـ SQL ويجيب بس النتائج المطلوبة.✅ المميزات:أعلى كفاءة مع قواعد البيانات الكبيرة.بيقلل حجم البيانات اللي بتتحمل في الذاكرة.🆚 مقارنة مبسطة📌 إمتى تستخدم كل واحدة؟استخدم IEnumerable لما تكون بتتعامل مع بيانات صغيرة أو بالفعل موجودة في الذاكرة.استخدم IQueryable لما تتعامل مع استعلامات على قاعدة بيانات وعايز أفضل أداء واسترجاع سريع.💡 مثال عملي (اختياري للبوست)// مثال على IEnumerablevar data = db.Users.ToList(); // البيانات اتحملت كلها هناvar filtered = data.Where(u => u.Age > 20);// مثال على IQueryablevar filtered = db.Users.Where(u => u.Age > 20); // التصفية بتحصل في DB مباشرة💬 لو وصلت لحد هنا، صلِّ على النبي ﷺ ❤️hashtag#DotNet hashtag#LINQ hashtag#Backend hashtag#CSharpTips hashtag#EFCore hashtag#EntityFramework hashtag#برمجة

And in our experience, this Q1 showed that sectors like ecommerce, data science, and machine learning continue to drive real demand for senior technical professionals in LATAM.Our Q1 Highlights: ・ 3 New projects from the US and Spain got signed・ 10 Technical hires for startups in AI powered tools・ We unlocked new expertise by looking for MLOps engineers, a branch of ML that we hadn't dived into beforeThis didn’t happen by chance.✨It’s the result of staying close to teams, understanding each stage of growth, and designing real solutions that help companies scale.To those who trust us to hire with purpose—thank you.And to the talent joining these challenges: you’re part of this story too.This quarter reminded us of something we already knew:Staying relevant in this industry isn’t about growing fast.
