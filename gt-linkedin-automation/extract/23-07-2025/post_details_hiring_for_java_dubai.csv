Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit.

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit.

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit.

If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson

Vlad ShytovVlad Shytov,,"Building Startup: How I Burned $500K and 15,000 Hours on OutsourcingIn 2020, I was just a regular guy doing pretty well in marketing, ads, and crypto (4+ yrs). But something always tugged at my heart: restaurants. Picking the right spot to eat was always meticulous - food, for me, was pure passion.I'd had some small experience opening restaurants, worked in one for about a year, and thought I understood this business from the inside out. COVID hit, and I felt this was my moment. I decided to go all-in no investors, just own money.My idea? Massive. An interactive social restaurant app with Uber-like mobile payments, full fintech integration, a gift system (sharing QR dishes with friends), multimodal loyalty programs (from bonus-based to hybrid models), franchise management tools, supply chain optimization, accounting, everything.Ambitious and financially stable at the time, I thought investments meant losing control like Travis Kalanick or Steve Jobs. I confidently jumped building Eatagram, a massive social network combining TripAdvisor's scale with Instagram's vibe. Instagram itself later hit us with multiple trademark claims, forcing rapid changes.I spared no expense. Dubai Internet City the priciest freezone, good lawyers, endless GDPR/CCPA compliance docs. I chose expensive tech stacks: Flutter apps, Java microservices, and dozens of pointless features. Thousands of hours went into unnecessary mockups, designs, and coding. By launch, mid-sized competitors were vanishing, crushed by giants like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Foursquare. I now doubt even they’ll survive the AI wave.Despite this, we built fully functional apps on Flutter for Android/iOS launched, live, but soon discarded into the digital graveyard.When war erupted in 2022, Eatagram froze. Six months later, refusing defeat, I pumped new cash into revival efforts. Complex pitch decks more like novels - than clear investment pitches consumed more time and money.Laughably, two investment ""consultants"" scammed me out of nearly €40k. Lesson learned painfully: Trust yourself. External advisors with shiny promises often deliver nothing.Only after two exhausting years did I finally stop, breathe, and learn proper Product Management: MVPs, cust devs, lean startup principles.Final damage? Around $500k on devs, plus another $500k on legal, compliance, consulting, companies (UAE/UK/US) , and marketing . I now realize most mistakes were entirely avoidable with early education and strategic hiring.The greatest lesson: The Team is everything. No outsourcing can replace an internal CTO or PM overseeing every crucial step. This journey is brutal, tough, but incredibly rewarding. Mistakes are costly teachers. But I’m proud I learned on my own dime, not investors'.Now, stronger and wiser, I'm rebuilding. This isn't failure it's foundation. Keep your head high, build a trusted team, and never quit. If you're struggling, remember: every hard lesson leads you closer to success.hashtag#Lesson
