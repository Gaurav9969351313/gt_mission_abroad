Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Pratik DasPratik Das,,now it's become even simpler to create MCP servers!!
Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1.

It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge.

Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1.

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1.

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage.

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

SOAP Processing Modelبيحدد الـ Rules الخاصة بكيفية معالجة SOAP Messages.2. SOAP Extensible Modelبيسمح بإضافة Features جديدة للـ SOAP.أمثلة:WS-SecurityWS-AddressingWS-ReliableMessaging3. SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4.

Lukasz CzajkowskiLukasz Czajkowski,,"Ouzo-Driven Innovation: Rethinking Transformation on the Shores of Crete(Long Polish May weekend parody post ;) )As global leaders debate AI ethics and supply chain resilience, a quiet but powerful shift is happening under the Mediterranean sun. Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3.

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Nada AssemNada Assem,,"Part 3 - Chapter 1 Summary from ""Building Web APIs using ASP .NET Core""في البوست اللي فات بدأنا نتكلم عن Architectures and Message Protocolsوفي Part 2 اتكلمنا عن REST كـ Architecture Style.النهارده في Part 3 هنتكلم عن SOAPSOAP = Simple Object Access Protocolهو عبارة عن Messaging Protocol لتبادل البيانات بين الأنظمة المختلفة باستخدام HTTP Protocol.Data Format المستخدم مع SOAP=> XML (Extensible Markup Language)تم تطوير SOAP لأول مرة من خلال Microsoft سنة 1999، بس لم يعتبر Standard ل Web إلا في سنة 2003 لما اعتمدته منظمة W3C كـ Recommendation.SOAP Messaging Framework Components1. SOAP Processing Modelبيحدد الـ Rules الخاصة بكيفية معالجة SOAP Messages.2. SOAP Extensible Modelبيسمح بإضافة Features جديدة للـ SOAP.أمثلة:WS-SecurityWS-AddressingWS-ReliableMessaging3. SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Lukasz CzajkowskiLukasz Czajkowski,,"Ouzo-Driven Innovation: Rethinking Transformation on the Shores of Crete(Long Polish May weekend parody post ;) )As global leaders debate AI ethics and supply chain resilience, a quiet but powerful shift is happening under the Mediterranean sun. Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Nada AssemNada Assem,,"Part 3 - Chapter 1 Summary from ""Building Web APIs using ASP .NET Core""في البوست اللي فات بدأنا نتكلم عن Architectures and Message Protocolsوفي Part 2 اتكلمنا عن REST كـ Architecture Style.النهارده في Part 3 هنتكلم عن SOAPSOAP = Simple Object Access Protocolهو عبارة عن Messaging Protocol لتبادل البيانات بين الأنظمة المختلفة باستخدام HTTP Protocol.Data Format المستخدم مع SOAP=> XML (Extensible Markup Language)تم تطوير SOAP لأول مرة من خلال Microsoft سنة 1999، بس لم يعتبر Standard ل Web إلا في سنة 2003 لما اعتمدته منظمة W3C كـ Recommendation.SOAP Messaging Framework Components1. SOAP Processing Modelبيحدد الـ Rules الخاصة بكيفية معالجة SOAP Messages.2. SOAP Extensible Modelبيسمح بإضافة Features جديدة للـ SOAP.أمثلة:WS-SecurityWS-AddressingWS-ReliableMessaging3. SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Lukasz CzajkowskiLukasz Czajkowski,,"Ouzo-Driven Innovation: Rethinking Transformation on the Shores of Crete(Long Polish May weekend parody post ;) )As global leaders debate AI ethics and supply chain resilience, a quiet but powerful shift is happening under the Mediterranean sun. Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1.

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage.

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

SOAP Processing Modelبيحدد الـ Rules الخاصة بكيفية معالجة SOAP Messages.2. SOAP Extensible Modelبيسمح بإضافة Features جديدة للـ SOAP.أمثلة:WS-SecurityWS-AddressingWS-ReliableMessaging3. SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Lukasz CzajkowskiLukasz Czajkowski,,"Ouzo-Driven Innovation: Rethinking Transformation on the Shores of Crete(Long Polish May weekend parody post ;) )As global leaders debate AI ethics and supply chain resilience, a quiet but powerful shift is happening under the Mediterranean sun. Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Nada AssemNada Assem,,"Part 3 - Chapter 1 Summary from ""Building Web APIs using ASP .NET Core""في البوست اللي فات بدأنا نتكلم عن Architectures and Message Protocolsوفي Part 2 اتكلمنا عن REST كـ Architecture Style.النهارده في Part 3 هنتكلم عن SOAPSOAP = Simple Object Access Protocolهو عبارة عن Messaging Protocol لتبادل البيانات بين الأنظمة المختلفة باستخدام HTTP Protocol.Data Format المستخدم مع SOAP=> XML (Extensible Markup Language)تم تطوير SOAP لأول مرة من خلال Microsoft سنة 1999، بس لم يعتبر Standard ل Web إلا في سنة 2003 لما اعتمدته منظمة W3C كـ Recommendation.SOAP Messaging Framework Components1. SOAP Processing Modelبيحدد الـ Rules الخاصة بكيفية معالجة SOAP Messages.2. SOAP Extensible Modelبيسمح بإضافة Features جديدة للـ SOAP.أمثلة:WS-SecurityWS-AddressingWS-ReliableMessaging3. SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Lukasz CzajkowskiLukasz Czajkowski,,"Ouzo-Driven Innovation: Rethinking Transformation on the Shores of Crete(Long Polish May weekend parody post ;) )As global leaders debate AI ethics and supply chain resilience, a quiet but powerful shift is happening under the Mediterranean sun. Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Ibad Ur RehmanIbad Ur Rehman,,"🛠️ The Journey from Frontend Dev to Full-Stack Pro Continues! 💪Just wrapped up another exciting part of Week 3.3 of my 36-week prep with Saifullah Khan Bhai — and this time, I tackled Authentication, Authorization, and JWTs — critical topics for securing real-world web applications! 🔐Here’s what I explored and implemented:🔐 How Authentication and Authorization Work Authentication is all about confirming who the user is (like logging in), while authorization is about what that user is allowed to do (like accessing admin-only routes). It’s the backbone of app security — especially when building user dashboards, admin panels, or role-based apps.🔑 What is JWT (JSON Web Token) and How It Works JWT is a compact, secure way of transmitting user identity across systems. After a user logs in, the server sends back a signed JWT — like a digital passport. This token is then sent with future requests to verify the user's identity without logging in again. It's widely used in modern web apps.🧾 JWT.sign() and JWT.verify() MethodsJWT.sign(payload, secret) creates a token using the user's data and a secret key.JWT.verify(token, secret) checks if the token is valid and unchanged.These methods ensure secure communication between the client and server.I used them in my project to protect routes and manage user sessions. 🔄✨ By understanding these core authentication patterns, I’m one step closer to building secure, scalable full-stack applications!hashtag#FullStackJourney hashtag#JWT hashtag#Authentication hashtag#Authorization hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#ExpressJS hashtag#WebSecurity hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#LearningInPublic hashtag#MERNStack hashtag#36WeekPrep hashtag#DevLife hashtag#WebDevPakistan

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Ibad Ur RehmanIbad Ur Rehman,,"🛠️ The Journey from Frontend Dev to Full-Stack Pro Continues! 💪Just wrapped up another exciting part of Week 3.3 of my 36-week prep with Saifullah Khan Bhai — and this time, I tackled Authentication, Authorization, and JWTs — critical topics for securing real-world web applications! 🔐Here’s what I explored and implemented:🔐 How Authentication and Authorization Work Authentication is all about confirming who the user is (like logging in), while authorization is about what that user is allowed to do (like accessing admin-only routes). It’s the backbone of app security — especially when building user dashboards, admin panels, or role-based apps.🔑 What is JWT (JSON Web Token) and How It Works JWT is a compact, secure way of transmitting user identity across systems. After a user logs in, the server sends back a signed JWT — like a digital passport. This token is then sent with future requests to verify the user's identity without logging in again. It's widely used in modern web apps.🧾 JWT.sign() and JWT.verify() MethodsJWT.sign(payload, secret) creates a token using the user's data and a secret key.JWT.verify(token, secret) checks if the token is valid and unchanged.These methods ensure secure communication between the client and server.I used them in my project to protect routes and manage user sessions. 🔄✨ By understanding these core authentication patterns, I’m one step closer to building secure, scalable full-stack applications!hashtag#FullStackJourney hashtag#JWT hashtag#Authentication hashtag#Authorization hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#ExpressJS hashtag#WebSecurity hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#LearningInPublic hashtag#MERNStack hashtag#36WeekPrep hashtag#DevLife hashtag#WebDevPakistan

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Lukasz CzajkowskiLukasz Czajkowski,,"Ouzo-Driven Innovation: Rethinking Transformation on the Shores of Crete(Long Polish May weekend parody post ;) )As global leaders debate AI ethics and supply chain resilience, a quiet but powerful shift is happening under the Mediterranean sun. Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Ibad Ur RehmanIbad Ur Rehman,,"🛠️ The Journey from Frontend Dev to Full-Stack Pro Continues! 💪Just wrapped up another exciting part of Week 3.3 of my 36-week prep with Saifullah Khan Bhai — and this time, I tackled Authentication, Authorization, and JWTs — critical topics for securing real-world web applications! 🔐Here’s what I explored and implemented:🔐 How Authentication and Authorization Work Authentication is all about confirming who the user is (like logging in), while authorization is about what that user is allowed to do (like accessing admin-only routes). It’s the backbone of app security — especially when building user dashboards, admin panels, or role-based apps.🔑 What is JWT (JSON Web Token) and How It Works JWT is a compact, secure way of transmitting user identity across systems. After a user logs in, the server sends back a signed JWT — like a digital passport. This token is then sent with future requests to verify the user's identity without logging in again. It's widely used in modern web apps.🧾 JWT.sign() and JWT.verify() MethodsJWT.sign(payload, secret) creates a token using the user's data and a secret key.JWT.verify(token, secret) checks if the token is valid and unchanged.These methods ensure secure communication between the client and server.I used them in my project to protect routes and manage user sessions. 🔄✨ By understanding these core authentication patterns, I’m one step closer to building secure, scalable full-stack applications!hashtag#FullStackJourney hashtag#JWT hashtag#Authentication hashtag#Authorization hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#ExpressJS hashtag#WebSecurity hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#LearningInPublic hashtag#MERNStack hashtag#36WeekPrep hashtag#DevLife hashtag#WebDevPakistan

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3.

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Nada AssemNada Assem,,"Part 3 - Chapter 1 Summary from ""Building Web APIs using ASP .NET Core""في البوست اللي فات بدأنا نتكلم عن Architectures and Message Protocolsوفي Part 2 اتكلمنا عن REST كـ Architecture Style.النهارده في Part 3 هنتكلم عن SOAPSOAP = Simple Object Access Protocolهو عبارة عن Messaging Protocol لتبادل البيانات بين الأنظمة المختلفة باستخدام HTTP Protocol.Data Format المستخدم مع SOAP=> XML (Extensible Markup Language)تم تطوير SOAP لأول مرة من خلال Microsoft سنة 1999، بس لم يعتبر Standard ل Web إلا في سنة 2003 لما اعتمدته منظمة W3C كـ Recommendation.SOAP Messaging Framework Components1. SOAP Processing Modelبيحدد الـ Rules الخاصة بكيفية معالجة SOAP Messages.2. SOAP Extensible Modelبيسمح بإضافة Features جديدة للـ SOAP.أمثلة:WS-SecurityWS-AddressingWS-ReliableMessaging3. SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Lukasz CzajkowskiLukasz Czajkowski,,"Ouzo-Driven Innovation: Rethinking Transformation on the Shores of Crete(Long Polish May weekend parody post ;) )As global leaders debate AI ethics and supply chain resilience, a quiet but powerful shift is happening under the Mediterranean sun. Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Ibad Ur RehmanIbad Ur Rehman,,"🛠️ The Journey from Frontend Dev to Full-Stack Pro Continues! 💪Just wrapped up another exciting part of Week 3.3 of my 36-week prep with Saifullah Khan Bhai — and this time, I tackled Authentication, Authorization, and JWTs — critical topics for securing real-world web applications! 🔐Here’s what I explored and implemented:🔐 How Authentication and Authorization Work Authentication is all about confirming who the user is (like logging in), while authorization is about what that user is allowed to do (like accessing admin-only routes). It’s the backbone of app security — especially when building user dashboards, admin panels, or role-based apps.🔑 What is JWT (JSON Web Token) and How It Works JWT is a compact, secure way of transmitting user identity across systems. After a user logs in, the server sends back a signed JWT — like a digital passport. This token is then sent with future requests to verify the user's identity without logging in again. It's widely used in modern web apps.🧾 JWT.sign() and JWT.verify() MethodsJWT.sign(payload, secret) creates a token using the user's data and a secret key.JWT.verify(token, secret) checks if the token is valid and unchanged.These methods ensure secure communication between the client and server.I used them in my project to protect routes and manage user sessions. 🔄✨ By understanding these core authentication patterns, I’m one step closer to building secure, scalable full-stack applications!hashtag#FullStackJourney hashtag#JWT hashtag#Authentication hashtag#Authorization hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#ExpressJS hashtag#WebSecurity hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#LearningInPublic hashtag#MERNStack hashtag#36WeekPrep hashtag#DevLife hashtag#WebDevPakistan

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

SOAP Processing Modelبيحدد الـ Rules الخاصة بكيفية معالجة SOAP Messages.2. SOAP Extensible Modelبيسمح بإضافة Features جديدة للـ SOAP.أمثلة:WS-SecurityWS-AddressingWS-ReliableMessaging3. SOAP Underlying Protocol Binding Frameworkبيحدد إزاي يتم إرسال SOAP Messages من خلال بروتوكولات مختلفة زي: HTTP, SMTP, JMSمميزات SOAP» بيسمح للمطورين بتوسيع البروتوكول عن طريق إضافات زي:WS-PolicyWS-SecurityWS-Federation (لتوثيق الهوية بين الأنظمة المختلفة)» بيستخدم WSDL (Web Services Description Language)وده ملف XML بيشرح كل الـ Web Services اللي الـ Server بيقدمها وبيوضح إزاي تتعامل معاها.عيوب SOAP» بيدعم XML بس ومفيش دعم لاي Data Formate أخف زي JSON» دعم أقل من المتصفحات الحديثة لأن أغلبها مبني على REST.» أداء أقل مقارنة بـ REST لأنه بيستخدم HTTP POST وبيكون أصعب في التخزين المؤقت (Caching) من REST اللي بيدعم GET.ودي مقارنه سريعه بين REST Vs SOAP 1. Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Here’s a clear breakdown of what I learned:1. API Endpoint  This is the main URL where the request is sent. It follows the format: `baseURL/Endpoint` (e.g.http://api.example.com/users).2. Path Parameters These are used to specify a particular resource. The format is: `baseURL/Endpoint/{path-parameter}` (e.g., https://api.example.comq/users/123). For example, ""123"" identifies a specific user.3. Query Parameters These are used to filter or sort data. The format is: `baseURL/Endpoint?query=value` hashtag#30days_of_learninghashtag#APIs

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Ibad Ur RehmanIbad Ur Rehman,,"🛠️ The Journey from Frontend Dev to Full-Stack Pro Continues! 💪Just wrapped up another exciting part of Week 3.3 of my 36-week prep with Saifullah Khan Bhai — and this time, I tackled Authentication, Authorization, and JWTs — critical topics for securing real-world web applications! 🔐Here’s what I explored and implemented:🔐 How Authentication and Authorization Work Authentication is all about confirming who the user is (like logging in), while authorization is about what that user is allowed to do (like accessing admin-only routes). It’s the backbone of app security — especially when building user dashboards, admin panels, or role-based apps.🔑 What is JWT (JSON Web Token) and How It Works JWT is a compact, secure way of transmitting user identity across systems. After a user logs in, the server sends back a signed JWT — like a digital passport. This token is then sent with future requests to verify the user's identity without logging in again. It's widely used in modern web apps.🧾 JWT.sign() and JWT.verify() MethodsJWT.sign(payload, secret) creates a token using the user's data and a secret key.JWT.verify(token, secret) checks if the token is valid and unchanged.These methods ensure secure communication between the client and server.I used them in my project to protect routes and manage user sessions. 🔄✨ By understanding these core authentication patterns, I’m one step closer to building secure, scalable full-stack applications!hashtag#FullStackJourney hashtag#JWT hashtag#Authentication hashtag#Authorization hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#ExpressJS hashtag#WebSecurity hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#LearningInPublic hashtag#MERNStack hashtag#36WeekPrep hashtag#DevLife hashtag#WebDevPakistan

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Shankar DayalShankar Dayal,,"Force Majeure: Back-to-Back relevanceIn interconnected contracts, especially where you (as seller) are the intermediary, mismatched Force Majeure (""FM"") clauses can leave you exposed. If your supplier is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the buyer doesn’t recognise the same event or relief, you could be held liable. The same applies if your buyer is excused from performance due to an FM event, but your contract with the seller does not recognise the same event. Why Back-to-Back FM Clauses Are Essential: 1. Risk Transfer Protection:• If a supplier invokes FM to delay or cancel delivery, the seller must also have the right to invoke FM with the buyer.• Without a back-to-back clause, the intermediary could still be liable to the buyer despite being unable to receive the goods from the supplier.Please note, this could apply similarly where the buyer invokes an FM event, where the intermediary would be liable to the supplier.2. Consistency in Legal Relief• Ensures both contracts excuse performance for the same types of unforeseen events (e.g., war, natural disasters, strikes).• Misalignment could result in one party being relieved while the other remains legally bound.3. Avoiding Commercial Gaps• For example, if the purchase contract includes pandemics as an FM event but the sale contract does not, the intermediary could be stuck with an unfulfillable obligation and no legal shield.4. Aligned Notice Requirements• Both contracts should include the same timing and method for notifying FM events.• If the supplier has 48 hours to notify but the buyer requires notice within 24 hours, the intermediary could lose the right to claim FM downstream.5. Termination Triggers• Many contracts allow termination if the FM persists beyond a certain period (e.g., 30 days).• Back-to-back durations are essential to avoid mismatched termination rights and prevent being forced into or out of a deal unfairly.Example:A trader buys steel coils from a mill in China under a contract with an FM clause that includes “natural disasters.” He sells to a European buyer under a contract without an FM clause, or without the FM clause including natural disasters as an FM event. If Chinese ports close due to an earthquake:• The supplier is excused from delivery.• The trader is still bound to deliver to the buyer or pay damages—unless the FM clause is mirrored.Conclusion:In trading and supply chain transactions, back-to-back Force Majeure clauses are not just legal formalities or boilerplate—they’re critical risk management tools. They ensure that when one party is excused from performance, the intermediary is not left exposed to penalties, claims, or losses from the other party.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Habeeb YusufHabeeb Yusuf,,"🚀 Excited to share my latest serverless project!I built a fully serverless contact form system using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB and SNS, eliminating the need for server management while embracing a scalable and efficient architecture.Here’s how it works:API Gateway handles form submissionsAWS Lambda processes the logic (Python)DynamoDB stores the form dataSNS sends real-time admin alertsCORS headers enable smooth frontend integrationIAM roles ensure secure, least-privilege accessThis project gave me the opportunity to build a flexible, secure, and easily scalable solution using serverless principles.What i learned: * The power of API Gateway in routing and handling form submissions with    ease: API Gateway plays a pivotal role in the entire serverless flow. It handles HTTP requests and routes them to the correct AWS Lambda function, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend. This makes it an essential tool for any serverless application, as it takes care of all the necessary HTTP request and response operations without requiring traditional server management.* How Lambda can simplify backend logic without managing traditional servers:AWS Lambda enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. In this project, I leveraged Lambda to handle form submissions, which allowed me to focus solely on the logic (written in Python) without worrying about underlying infrastructure. This means no need for instance scaling or server maintenance—Lambda takes care of the scaling automatically based on the number of requests, making it a powerful tool for lightweight, cost-effective solutions.* The importance of setting up CORS headers properly for seamless integration with frontend applications: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a crucial part of enabling smooth communication between a frontend (e.g., a web application) and a backend API hosted on a different domain. In this project, setting up CORS headers correctly allowed my frontend to make secure and successful API requests to the Lambda functions behind API Gateway. Without proper CORS configuration, you’d run into errors that would block requests, making the integration process a challenge. Handling CORS properly is essential for serverless architectures to work seamlessly across different domains.📝 Check out the full project walkthrough here:

Adnane El khailiAdnane El khaili,,"Is ""Consideration"" still relevant in Modern Contract Law?🤔"" العقود العوضية ""👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻In an age of digital transactions, subscription models, and smart contracts, some might wonder: does the Doctrine of Consideration still matter?⁉️❓❓❓The answer is yes ✔️... and here's why:👇🏻⏩ The Doctrine of ""Consideration"" ensures that a contract reflects a mutual exchange. It's not just about promises, it's about value. Whether it's payment for a service, access to software, or even agreeing to refrain from a certain action, consideration creates the legal backbone that makes the agreement enforceable.⏩ Modern contracts may look different such as Clickwrap agreements, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Influencer Brand Deals, but the principle remains: no ""Consideration"", no binding contract.⏩ Even in jurisdictions exploring contract reform, the idea that both parties must give something to get something remains a key safeguard against unfair or one-sided obligations.⏩ Understanding ""Consideration"" is essential for legal professionals, founders, and anyone involved in ""deal-making"" in the digital economy.🎬 What are your thoughts on how technology is changing the way we handle contracts❓ hashtag#ContractLaw hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#DigitalContracts hashtag#ModernLaw hashtag#TechAndLaw hashtag#StartupLaw hashtag#SaaSContracts hashtag#BusinessLaw hashtag#Consideration hashtag#LegalBasicshashtag#القانون hashtag#العقود hashtag#القانون_المدني hashtag#القانون_التجاري hashtag#التحول_الرقمي hashtag#عقود_عوضية hashtag#الذكاء_الاصطناعي_والقانون hashtag#ريادة_الأعمال_القانونية hashtag#العمل_القانوني hashtag#القانون_والتكنولوجيات_الحديثة

Sylvia Okparaeke CAMSSylvia Okparaeke CAMS,,"A Note to my Fellow General Counsels: Protect Your Business First.I’ve been reviewing a lot of agreements lately and i thought to share this:When reviewing legal agreements, always begin with the end in mind. Assume realistically, that the relationship may deteriorate. Your role is to ensure your organisation is insulated when it does.One of the most critical tools in your arsenal? The termination clause.Scrutinise it. Then scrutinise the clauses that hinge on it; notice periods, payment obligations, survival provisions, dispute mechanisms. These are not boilerplate. They are strategy. Spin it in all ways till you are comfortable with the way it sounds should the relationship breakdown. Insist on the right to terminate without cause. Say it clearly: “We reserve the right to terminate this agreement at any time, without cause, by providing a 5-day written notice.” Nothing about your termination clause should be ambiguous or interpreted in a way that can give rise to a different meaning but that which you intended. Any attempt by the counterparty to dilute or eliminate this right should be met with resistance, or at minimum, renegotiated with leverage. If you’re the party with power, exercise it. If you’re not, structure flexibility into the agreement early.Termination without cause is not just a fallback. It’s your legal parachute.🪂hashtag#GeneralCounsel hashtag#LegalLeadership hashtag#ExecutiveLeadership.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Alaa DamajAlaa Damaj,,"Well-designed APIs behave consistently, fair predictably, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:1 - Resource-oriented paths and proper use of HTTP verbs help APIs align with standard tools.2 - Use a proper API versioning approach.3 - Use standard error codes while generating API responses.4 - APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.5 - Idempotency keys allow clients to safely deduplicate operations with side effects.6 - APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based, cursor-based, and keyset-based.7 - API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms. HTTPS is also a must-have for APIs running in production.

Architecture StyleSOAP:بيعتمد على XML وWSDL وبيشتغل غالبا على HTTP protocol ، لكن ممكن كمان يشتغل على Protocols تانية زي SMTP.REST: Architecture Style بيعتمد على HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT,DELETE) وبيتعامل مع ال Resources من خلال URIs.2. Data FormateSOAP: بيدعم XML فقطREST:بيدعم أكتر من Formate  (JSON, XML, Text)  3. PerformanceSOAP:أبطأ بسبب استخدام XML وحجم الرسائل الكبير وصعب في الـ Caching.REST:أسرع وأخف، وبيستفيد من Caching خصوصًا مع HTTP GET.4. SecuritySOAP:بيدعم Security Standards قوية زي WS-Security، ومناسب للأنظمة اللي بتحتاج أمان عالي (زي البنوك).REST:بيعتمد على HTTPS وAuthentication بسيط زي OAuth و JWT  لكنه مش بنفس قوة SOAP في بعض السيناريوهات.5.DescriptionSOAP:بيستخدم WSDL (XML File) بيشرح كل تفاصيل الـ Web Service.REST:مفيش Standard واحدة، لكن ممكن نستخدم Swagger لتوثيق الـ APIs.

Here on Crete, I’ve spent the last few days deep-diving into a radically decentralized, ouzo-fueled innovation ecosystem — and the insights are staggering.This island isn’t just a vacation spot. It’s a next-gen sandbox for sun-powered cognitive agility. Every taverna is a use case. Every glass of ouzo? A local MVP (Minimum Viable Productivity).Key takeaways from the Cretan Tech Stack:➡️Liquid-Led Ideation: Traditional brainstorming is out. “OuzoStorming™” encourages asynchronous ideation supported by grilled squid and ambient goat sounds.➡️Decentralized Agility: Herding cats? Try herding donkeys through olive groves. The agile metaphor is alive and braying.➡️Zorba-as-a-Service (ZaaS): Local dance-based leadership rituals now drive team cohesion and real-time alignment, measured in BPM (Beats per Minute).➡️Relax-to-Earn Infrastructure: Blockchain-enhanced beach chairs allow for staking your towel and generating “Passive Leisure Yield.” Optional NFT upgrade includes a frappe.➡️Embedded UX Rituals: Every strategic lunch concludes with unsolicited raki and dessert — a UX feature that transforms customer journeys into literal sugar rushes.➡️Ambient Feline Monitoring (AFM): Strategic feline deployment (i.e. street cats) ensures continuous surveillance of sidewalk sentiment and supports natural pest control in legacy systems.➡️Wisdom-as-a-Platform (WaaP): Elderly Greek men form decentralized knowledge hubs (a.k.a. kafeneio clusters), delivering continuous, unfiltered socio-political commentary in analog format, with optional smoke signal outputs.➡️Farm-to-Framework Cuisine: Local KPIs include “Daily Freshness Index,” measured in tomato juiciness and feta salinity. Culinary ops are lean, green, and olive-oil optimized.Crete isn’t just following trends — it’s disrupting disruption itself. For anyone in BSS, FDI, AI, ESG, DEI, BYOB or just REST — this island is a must-watch.More insights to follow...after my next raki.hashtag#crete hashtag#greece hashtag#weekend hashtag#parody

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Ibad Ur RehmanIbad Ur Rehman,,"🛠️ The Journey from Frontend Dev to Full-Stack Pro Continues! 💪Just wrapped up another exciting part of Week 3.3 of my 36-week prep with Saifullah Khan Bhai — and this time, I tackled Authentication, Authorization, and JWTs — critical topics for securing real-world web applications! 🔐Here’s what I explored and implemented:🔐 How Authentication and Authorization Work Authentication is all about confirming who the user is (like logging in), while authorization is about what that user is allowed to do (like accessing admin-only routes). It’s the backbone of app security — especially when building user dashboards, admin panels, or role-based apps.🔑 What is JWT (JSON Web Token) and How It Works JWT is a compact, secure way of transmitting user identity across systems. After a user logs in, the server sends back a signed JWT — like a digital passport. This token is then sent with future requests to verify the user's identity without logging in again. It's widely used in modern web apps.🧾 JWT.sign() and JWT.verify() MethodsJWT.sign(payload, secret) creates a token using the user's data and a secret key.JWT.verify(token, secret) checks if the token is valid and unchanged.These methods ensure secure communication between the client and server.I used them in my project to protect routes and manage user sessions. 🔄✨ By understanding these core authentication patterns, I’m one step closer to building secure, scalable full-stack applications!hashtag#FullStackJourney hashtag#JWT hashtag#Authentication hashtag#Authorization hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#ExpressJS hashtag#WebSecurity hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#LearningInPublic hashtag#MERNStack hashtag#36WeekPrep hashtag#DevLife hashtag#WebDevPakistan

Collins Macharia MuturiCollins Macharia Muturi,,"🚀 Just Built a Fuel Cost Estimation & Route Optimization API! 🛣️⛽Over the past few weeks, I’ve been immersed in building a geospatial API designed to streamline long-distance trip planning by:✔️ Geocoding start and end locations ✔️ Retrieving route data via Mapbox ✔️ Placing stop points every 500 miles ✔️ Identifying cheapest fuel stations near stop points using uploaded data ✔️ Calculating total fuel cost based on MPG and station prices ✔️ Generating interactive maps showing the full route and fuel stops using Folium✔️HTML & CSS for an appealing Frontend User Interface🧱 A pivotal part of this project was using the Django framework, which provided the foundation for clean, scalable, and RESTful API architecture. Django’s robustness made it easy to manage routes, handle incoming requests, and maintain consistent logic across endpoints.🧪 To maintain data privacy and practice ethical development, I used Mockaroo to generate synthetic but realistic fuel station data. This allowed me to simulate real-world use cases without compromising sensitive information.🔄 Even better, this API is flexible — it can work with any fuel station dataset, as long as the column naming conventions align with the API’s structure (e.g., latitude, longitude, price, station_name, etc.). This means it’s easily adaptable to real-world systems and different data sources.🛠️ Tech Stack:Django for backend API developmentPython for core logicPandas for data wranglingRequests for external API calls (Mapbox, Nominatim)Geopy & Haversine for geospatial calculationsFolium for route and map visualizationMockaroo for mock data generation🧠 Key Takeaways:Django streamlines the process of building scalable, modular APIsClean, consistent data input is crucial for reliable APIsLocation data should always be validated before processingPracticing data privacy and protection is non-negotiable, even during testingMock data can be just as powerful as real data in the dev phaseThis API project is part of my continued journey into ethical, geospatial, and data-driven solution development.
