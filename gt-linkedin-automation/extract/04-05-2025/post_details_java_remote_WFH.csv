Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming.

If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

HardFault IndiaHardFault India,,Diving Deep into OpenThread Architecture for STM32WB
James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

HardFault IndiaHardFault India,,Diving Deep into OpenThread Architecture for STM32WB
James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems? Let’s talk—drop your questions below!hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#PHP hashtag#C hashtag#Linux hashtag#WebSocket

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2.

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

HardFault IndiaHardFault India,,Diving Deep into OpenThread Architecture for STM32WB
James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Amr ElNakibAmr ElNakib,,"The Future of Work: From Remote to HybridA global shift is happening — not just in where we work, but how we work, Capgemini’s research offers powerful insights:• 75% of organizations expect at least 30% of their workforce to remain remote.• Remote work boosted productivity by 13%–24% and cut real estate and operational costs.• Yet, 55% of employees report burnout, and 50% of new hires feel disconnected.• The future is hybrid: flexible, inclusive, and digitally empowered.• Organizations must rethink leadership, technology, culture, and employee experience to thrive.Hybrid work is not just a trend — it’s a transformation. Are we ready for it?⸻مستقبل العمل: من العمل عن بُعد إلى النموذج الهجيننشهد تحولًا عالميًا لا يقتصر على مكان العمل، بل يشمل كيفية أداء العمل. ويقدّم تقرير Capgemini رؤى مهمّة: •	75٪ من الجهات تتوقع استمرار 30٪ من موظفيها في العمل عن بُعد. •	العمل عن بُعد رفع الإنتاجية بنسبة بين 13٪ و24٪، وساهم في خفض التكاليف العقارية والتشغيلية. •	لكن 55٪ من الموظفين يشعرون بالإرهاق، و50٪ من المنضمين الجدد يشعرون بالعزلة. •	المستقبل هو للعمل الهجين: أكثر مرونة، وأكثر شمولًا، وأكثر دعمًا رقميًا. •	تحتاج المؤسسات لإعادة التفكير في القيادة، والتقنية، والثقافة، وتجربة الموظف لتحقيق النجاح.العمل الهجين ليس مجرد توجّه، بل تحوّل جذري. هل نحن مستعدون؟Certainly!

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Omkar ModiOmkar Modi,,"🎯 Today's Java Learning : Mastering Strings📌 I explored one of the most essential topics in Java Strings.Here's what i learned :🚀What is String in Java?A sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

HardFault IndiaHardFault India,,Diving Deep into OpenThread Architecture for STM32WB
James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Omkar ModiOmkar Modi,,"🎯 Today's Java Learning : Mastering Strings📌 I explored one of the most essential topics in Java Strings.Here's what i learned :🚀What is String in Java?A sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

HardFault IndiaHardFault India,,Diving Deep into OpenThread Architecture for STM32WB
James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems? Let’s talk—drop your questions below!hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#PHP hashtag#C hashtag#Linux hashtag#WebSocket

The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Omkar ModiOmkar Modi,,"🎯 Today's Java Learning : Mastering Strings📌 I explored one of the most essential topics in Java Strings.Here's what i learned :🚀What is String in Java?A sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Omkar ModiOmkar Modi,,"🎯 Today's Java Learning : Mastering Strings📌 I explored one of the most essential topics in Java Strings.Here's what i learned :🚀What is String in Java?A sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Mohamed Hisham Abdullatif AhmedMohamed Hisham Abdullatif Ahmed,,"تعرف وش الفرق بين المصطلحات الثلاثة RID, PDC, Infrastructure في AD؟هي أدوار من ضمن ما يسمى بـ:FSMO Roles (Flexible Single Master Operations)في كل Domain داخل Active Directory، هناك 5 أدوار FSMO، ثلاثة منها تكون Domain-specific (أي لكل Domain) وهي التي سأشرحها لك، و2 تكون Forest-wide✅ 1. RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Amr ElNakibAmr ElNakib,,"The Future of Work: From Remote to HybridA global shift is happening — not just in where we work, but how we work, Capgemini’s research offers powerful insights:• 75% of organizations expect at least 30% of their workforce to remain remote.• Remote work boosted productivity by 13%–24% and cut real estate and operational costs.• Yet, 55% of employees report burnout, and 50% of new hires feel disconnected.• The future is hybrid: flexible, inclusive, and digitally empowered.• Organizations must rethink leadership, technology, culture, and employee experience to thrive.Hybrid work is not just a trend — it’s a transformation. Are we ready for it?⸻مستقبل العمل: من العمل عن بُعد إلى النموذج الهجيننشهد تحولًا عالميًا لا يقتصر على مكان العمل، بل يشمل كيفية أداء العمل. ويقدّم تقرير Capgemini رؤى مهمّة: •	75٪ من الجهات تتوقع استمرار 30٪ من موظفيها في العمل عن بُعد. •	العمل عن بُعد رفع الإنتاجية بنسبة بين 13٪ و24٪، وساهم في خفض التكاليف العقارية والتشغيلية. •	لكن 55٪ من الموظفين يشعرون بالإرهاق، و50٪ من المنضمين الجدد يشعرون بالعزلة. •	المستقبل هو للعمل الهجين: أكثر مرونة، وأكثر شمولًا، وأكثر دعمًا رقميًا. •	تحتاج المؤسسات لإعادة التفكير في القيادة، والتقنية، والثقافة، وتجربة الموظف لتحقيق النجاح.العمل الهجين ليس مجرد توجّه، بل تحوّل جذري. هل نحن مستعدون؟Certainly!

Michaela LangMichaela Lang,,"As mentioned, fine graned authorization for metrics. The POC I am building is based upon cerbos (cerbos.dev).Assuming we have either a centralized or many distributed Thanos/Prometheus endpoints to fetch metrics from and the user utilized one observability UI. Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Omkar ModiOmkar Modi,,"🎯 Today's Java Learning : Mastering Strings📌 I explored one of the most essential topics in Java Strings.Here's what i learned :🚀What is String in Java?A sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Omkar ModiOmkar Modi,,"🎯 Today's Java Learning : Mastering Strings📌 I explored one of the most essential topics in Java Strings.Here's what i learned :🚀What is String in Java?A sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Shivani WakdeShivani Wakde,,"🚀 Why Logging Is a Developer's Best Friend – Especially for Java Devs ☕In the fast-paced world of software development, logging isn't just about printing messages, it's about observability, debugging, performance monitoring, and security.🔍 Why Logging Matters:• Diagnoses production issues without stepping through code• Provides a clear audit trail for compliance and security• Identifies performance bottlenecks• Helps track user behavior and application flow🛠️ Best Practices to Follow While Logging:✅ Use Logging Frameworks like SLF4J + Logback or Log4j2Avoid System.out.println; it's not scalable or manageable.🧭 Use Appropriate Log LevelsERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE – use them intentionally to avoid noise.🔐 Never Log Sensitive DataKeep personal info, credentials, and tokens out of logs.⚡ Use Parameterized LoggingAvoid string concatenation; use {} placeholders to enhance performance.📄 Keep Logs StructuredUse JSON or key-value pairs, so logs are machine-parsable and searchable (works well with ELK, Splunk, etc.).🧠 Add Context to LogsInclude user ID, request ID, session ID, or any business key to make logs actionable.🗂️ Organize Logs by Domain, Module, or WorkflowLogging per business domain or workflow (like OrderService, InvoiceProcessing) enables faster issue localization.📦 Log Exceptions with Stack TracesDon’t swallow exceptions—log the stack trace to trace the root cause easily.🚦 Avoid Logging Too Verbosely in ProductionEnable only necessary log levels (like INFO and ERROR) in prod.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

HardFault IndiaHardFault India,,Diving Deep into OpenThread Architecture for STM32WB
James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Charles MasonCharles Mason,,"Designation Notice – Continuity Base AlphaThe Old Viscose Plant, Garden City – Roanoke, VAEffective May 10, 2025Today, the Tier 0 Continuity Authority formally designates the historic Viscose Plant site in Garden City as Continuity Base Alpha — the national fusion node for emergency rail response, cybersecurity, and continuity-grade energy command.This is not a property claim — it’s a designation of national continuity function. We’re not claiming land. We’re anchoring readiness.We’re not asking for land. We’re offering readiness — mapped, structured, and built on Roanoke’s legacy.Roanoke once fueled the nation. It now protects it.From this site, we envision:1.     A Tier 0-grade Rail Cybersecurity & SCADA Isolation Command2.     Emergency Rail Response Force (ERRF) Staging and Dispatch3.     A hybrid cloud Tier 0 data center (air-gapped from the open internet — but connected to trusted local, state, federal, and command-grade networks. Designed for 9x9 uptime. No breach. No doomscroll. Just dispatch)4.     High-speed rail + light rail continuity testing ground5.     Grid-tied resilience via APCO + river cooling loopVirginia Tech — your SCADA research, continuity innovation, and cybersecurity depth will shape what we build here.

Omkar ModiOmkar Modi,,"🎯 Today's Java Learning : Mastering Strings📌 I explored one of the most essential topics in Java Strings.Here's what i learned :🚀What is String in Java?A sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Shivani WakdeShivani Wakde,,"🚀 Why Logging Is a Developer's Best Friend – Especially for Java Devs ☕In the fast-paced world of software development, logging isn't just about printing messages, it's about observability, debugging, performance monitoring, and security.🔍 Why Logging Matters:• Diagnoses production issues without stepping through code• Provides a clear audit trail for compliance and security• Identifies performance bottlenecks• Helps track user behavior and application flow🛠️ Best Practices to Follow While Logging:✅ Use Logging Frameworks like SLF4J + Logback or Log4j2Avoid System.out.println; it's not scalable or manageable.🧭 Use Appropriate Log LevelsERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE – use them intentionally to avoid noise.🔐 Never Log Sensitive DataKeep personal info, credentials, and tokens out of logs.⚡ Use Parameterized LoggingAvoid string concatenation; use {} placeholders to enhance performance.📄 Keep Logs StructuredUse JSON or key-value pairs, so logs are machine-parsable and searchable (works well with ELK, Splunk, etc.).🧠 Add Context to LogsInclude user ID, request ID, session ID, or any business key to make logs actionable.🗂️ Organize Logs by Domain, Module, or WorkflowLogging per business domain or workflow (like OrderService, InvoiceProcessing) enables faster issue localization.📦 Log Exceptions with Stack TracesDon’t swallow exceptions—log the stack trace to trace the root cause easily.🚦 Avoid Logging Too Verbosely in ProductionEnable only necessary log levels (like INFO and ERROR) in prod. DEBUG should be reserved for dev/staging.📊 Integrate with Monitoring & Alerting ToolsStream logs to observability tools like ELK, Grafana, or Prometheus. Set alerts for specific error patterns.🌐 Correlate Logs Across MicroservicesUse correlation/request IDs to track a single user request across multiple services.♻️ Rotate & Archive LogsManage log file size with rotation policies to avoid disk space issues.

Elias FilhoElias Filho,,"Working with watchdog timers in RTOS systems brings interesting challenges.The basic idea is simple: the watchdog counts down and resets the system if it’s not reloaded in time useful to detect infinite loops or system hangs.But in multitask systems with different deadlines (e.g., one task running every 10ms, another every 100ms), feeding the watchdog from each task becomes unreliable and messy (due to timing and concurrency issues).Some alternatives I’ve explored: - Idle-priority task feeding: Since the feeder task has the lowest priority, if any higher-priority task hangs, the watchdog won’t be fed and will eventually reset the system. - Task notification system: Each task sends an “I’m alive” signal to a watchdog monitor. If one fails, you can react more precisely, like restart only the faulty task if a full system reset isn’t necessary.While reading the hashtag#ZephyrRTOS docs, i've found a great solution called Task Watchdog:It uses kernel software timers to monitor tasks and can trigger custom callback functions when a task fails to reset its own timer. We can define per-task deadlines and recovery behavior, and still fall back to the hardware watchdog if needed.I might try this feature in my Zephyr-based cruise control system if I get the time, and if so, I’ll share some of the results.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Ayman DayfAyman Dayf,,"DPDK, eBPF, and XDP: Their Crucial Roles in Virtual NetworkingIn virtual networking, DPDK, eBPF, and XDP each offer distinct advantages for optimizing performance, security, and observability. DPDK excels in high-performance, low-latency packet processing by bypassing the kernel, making it ideal for user-space network functions like virtual switches (OVS-DPDK) and virtual network functions (VNFs), where throughput and customizability are critical. eBPF, running in the kernel, enables efficient network observability, security policy enforcement, and deep packet inspection with minimal overhead. It is often integrated into Kubernetes CNI plugins like Cilium and Calico for network visibility and microsegmentation. XDP, built on top of eBPF, provides ultra-fast ingress filtering by executing programs directly at the NIC driver level, making it ideal for early packet filtering and load balancing, which reduces network congestion and latency in multi-tenant environments. Together, these technologies power modern cloud-native networks, providing high performance, flexible security, and granular control, particularly in virtualized environments like Kubernetes and NFV architectures.1. DPDKIdeal for virtual switches, VNFs, and edge compute gateways.Enables performance similar to hardware appliances.Extensively used in OpenStack and telecom NFV solutions.2. eBPF Powers Cilium, Tetragon, and other Kubernetes CNIs and observability tools.Integrates with Linux namespaces, cgroups, containers, and VMs.Extensible without kernel patches, supporting zero-trust security models.Limited performance vs DPDK in raw throughput.3. XDFIdeal for DDOS mitigation, early firewalling, and L4 load balancing.Reduces load on host networking stack yet important in multi-tenant environments.Limited programmability compared to full eBPF (no loops, tight instruction budget).Widely used in Cilium, Facebook Katran, and cloud CNI pipelines.hashtag#DPDK hashtag#eBPF hashtag#XDP hashtag#Cilium hashtag#Katran hashtag#CNI hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Tetragon hashtag#OVS

Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡Mohammad Khabiri🧑‍💻📡,,"🧠 Deep Dive: From Notification Failure to Protocol Insight – Debugging SCTP_SEND_FAILEDIn this post, I walk through a subtle but critical SCTP issue that emerged when handling SCTP_SEND_FAILED notifications — exploring how low-level socket events, memory layout, and system-generated notification structures like sctp_send_failed reveal the real root cause behind failed datagram delivery in production.🔍 Unpacking SCTP_SEND_FAILED: From Kernel Notification to Root CauseIn SCTP-based communication systems, handling failure gracefully is as critical as achieving successful transmission. This post traces a real-world debugging session triggered by a recurring SCTP_SEND_FAILED notification — often dismissed as a low-level socket error, but here unpacked layer by layer to reveal deep transport-level insights.We begin at the point of failure: a datagram silently dropped, triggering a structured SCTP notification. Using sctp_send_failed and its fields (ssf_type, ssf_flags, ssf_error, and ssf_info), we decode the kernel's message about why the send operation couldn't complete. We show how to safely extract this information from a raw notification buffer, interpret the semantics of each field, and map it back to application-layer intent.To go deeper, we captured traffic with Wireshark and discovered a critical clue: a heartbeat message sent from a Docker container to our system, which unexpectedly led to the abortion of the SCTP association. This insight helped correlate the SCTP_SEND_FAILED with external traffic patterns, uncovering the real trigger — an out-of-band heartbeat interpreted as a protocol violation or arriving during a teardown state.By analyzing memory handling, buffer reuse, and edge-case protocol behavior (like full receive queues or association termination), we arrived at a concrete cause — often buried deep beneath user-facing symptoms. This is a story of system-level observability, correct struct alignment, and mastering the contract between user space and kernel through precise data interpretation.Ideal for engineers working with SCTP, E2AP, or any protocol stack that depends on robust notification handling.I’d be glad to collaborate on any projects in the fields of telecommunications systems, wireless networks, network protocols, or low-level programming. If you believe my experience and skills can contribute to your work, I’d be more than happy to be part of your team — even in a small role.

Hem Sharan Gupta AmarthaluriHem Sharan Gupta Amarthaluri,,"Introducing Wizzy — a surveillance and patrolling robot I developed as part of my Tinker Lab project, designed to work in environments where traditional CCTV systems fall short.Wizzy is more than just a mobile bot. It’s a self-thinking, self-correcting system powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 — capable of intelligent patrolling, real-time decision-making, and remote monitoring. Built with flexibility and scalability in mind, Wizzy is ideal for warehouses, mid-sized factories, or secure zones where both movement and memory matter.What makes Wizzy tick:1) Smart Patrol System: Avoids getting stuck, detects patterns, and makes decisions based on sensor input2) Memory of previous states and paths: Reduces repeated loops and improves efficiency over time3) Remote Surveillance: Includes a web dashboard for manual control and camera feed access4) Real-time camera monitoring: Captures and transmits visual data during patrol5) Modular codebase: Clean Python code with multithreading and behavior modelingUnder the hood: Wizzy’s core logic is written in Python, using multithreading for non-blocking patrol control. The SmartPatrol engine implements a stateful decision system — analyzing IR sensor inputs to detect obstacles, identify stuck loops, and dynamically choose optimal turn directions. It uses pattern history (via deques), state memory, and an adaptive escape mechanism to enhance area coverage. Motion control, decision branches, and environmental feedback are abstracted for flexibility and reusability.The entire project is open-source and available here: 🔗 https://lnkd.in/dY4KyM3BThis started as a college submission — but I see it as the first step toward practical, deployable surveillance robotics.hashtag#Robotics hashtag#Automation hashtag#Surveillance hashtag#RaspberryPi hashtag#PythonProjects hashtag#CollegeProjects hashtag#SmartSecurity hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#WizzyBot hashtag#OpenSource

RID Master (Relative Identifier Master)مسؤول عن توزيع الـ RID pools (حزم الأرقام المميزة) على الـ Domain Controllers في نفس الدومين.كل حساب مستخدم أو كمبيوتر أو مجموعة في AD له SID (Security Identifier) يتكون من:SID الأساسي للدومين.رقم RID مميز لكل كائن.الـ RID Master يضمن عدم تكرار الأرقام بتوزيعها لكل DC، وكل DC يصرف من الحزمة اللي عنده.🎯 بدونه؟ لو تعطل، تقدر تشتغل لفترة، لكن لو خلصت الـRID من الـDC، ما تقدر تنشئ كائنات جديدة.✅ 2. PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller Emulator)هذا الدور هو الأهم بينهم.مسؤول عن:التعامل مع الأنظمة القديمة (قبل Windows 2000) التي تحتاج ""PDC"".تنسيق تغيير كلمات المرور بين الـDCs (إذا غير مستخدم كلمة السر، يتأكد بسرعة).يعالج Account lockouts.المصدر الأساسي لتوقيت الساعة (time source) داخل الدومين.يُعتبر المرجع لأي تغييرات تحتاج أولوية.🎯 بدونه؟ مشاكل في مزامنة كلمة المرور، ومشاكل في التوقيت، وقد تظهر أخطاء في المصادقة.✅ 3. Infrastructure Masterمسؤول عن تحديث المراجع (references) للكائنات عندما يتم تغييرها عبر الدومين.مثلاً:لديك مجموعة تحتوي على أعضاء من دومين آخر.إذا تم إعادة تسمية أو نقل عضو من الدومين الآخر، الـ Infrastructure Master يحدث المعلومة داخل الدومين.🎯 بدونه؟ قد ترى أسماء قديمة أو معلومات غير محدثة عن كائنات الدومينات الأخرى.📝 ملاحظة مهمة: إذا كان جميع الـ Domain Controllers في الدومين يعملون كـ Global Catalog (GC)، فدور الـ Infrastructure Master يصبح بلا تأثير تقريباً.🏁 خلاصة:كل واحد منهم يلعب دور محدد داخل Domain لضمان عمل Active Directory بشكل صحيح ومنسق. عادةً، يتم استضافة هذه الأدوار الثلاثة على Domain Controller واحد (خاصة في بيئات صغيرة)، لكن في بيئات كبيرة يتم توزيعها حسب الحاجة.

Roozbeh NorooziRoozbeh Noroozi,,"آزمون رسمی CISSP چگونه است؟بخش اول : CATروش CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) که توسط سازمان ISC2 برای آزمون‌های CISSP و سایر گواهینامه‌ها استفاده می‌شود، یک شیوه نوین و هوشمندانه برای ارزیابی توانمندی‌های داوطلبان است. این روش با هدف افزایش دقت، کارایی و امنیت آزمون طراحی شده است. نحوه عملکرد آزمون CATدر آزمون CAT، هر داوطلب با سؤالاتی مواجه می‌شود که به‌صورت پویا و بر اساس عملکرد قبلی او انتخاب می‌شوند. فرآیند به این صورت است:1. شروع با سؤالات ساده‌تر: آزمون با سؤالی آغاز می‌شود که سطح دشواری آن پایین‌تر از حد استاندارد قبولی است.2. تنظیم سطح دشواری: پس از هر پاسخ، الگوریتم آزمون توانایی داوطلب را مجدداً ارزیابی می‌کند و بر اساس آن، سؤال بعدی را با سطح دشواری مناسب انتخاب می‌کند.3. هدف‌گیری دقت ۵۰٪: سیستم سعی می‌کند سؤالاتی ارائه دهد که احتمال پاسخ صحیح داوطلب به آن‌ها حدود ۵۰٪ باشد، تا بتواند سطح واقعی توانایی او را به‌دقت تعیین کند.4. تعیین پایان آزمون: آزمون زمانی پایان می‌یابد که سیستم با اطمینان ۹۵٪ بتواند تصمیم بگیرد که داوطلب موفق شده یا نه، یا زمانی که حداکثر تعداد سؤالات مجاز پاسخ داده شده باشد.مشخصات آزمون CISSP در قالب CAT* تعداد سؤالات: بین ۱۰۰ تا ۱۵۰ سؤال، که شامل ۲۵ سؤال آزمایشی (بدون نمره) نیز می‌شود.* حداقل سؤالات نمره‌دار: داوطلب باید حداقل به ۷۵ سؤال نمره‌دار پاسخ دهد.* مدت زمان آزمون: کاهش یافته از ۶ ساعت به حداکثر ۳ ساعتنمره قبولی: کسب حداقل ۷۰۰ از ۱۰۰۰ نمره ممکن.فرمت سؤالات: چندگزینه‌ای و سؤالات نوآورانه پیشرفته.زبان‌های موجود: انگلیسی، چینی، آلمانی، ژاپنی و اسپانیایی.مزایای استفاده از CATارزیابی دقیق‌تر و کارآمدتر: با تنظیم سطح دشواری سؤالات بر اساس عملکرد داوطلب، ارزیابی دقیق‌تری از توانمندی‌های او به‌دست می‌آید.کاهش مدت زمان آزمون: در مقایسه با آزمون‌های سنتی، CAT مدت زمان کمتری برای ارزیابی نیاز دارد. مثلا قبلا CISSP به مدت ۶ ساعت برگزار می‌شد.افزایش امنیت آزمون: با تنوع سؤالات و ترتیب آن‌ها برای هر داوطلب، احتمال تقلب کاهش می‌یابد.تجربه شخصی‌سازی‌شده برای داوطلبان: هر داوطلب با مسیر آزمونی منحصربه‌فرد مواجه می‌شود که متناسب با سطح توانایی اوست. تغییرات آینده در آزمون‌های ISC2از ۱ اکتبر ۲۰۲۵، آزمون‌های CC، CCSP و SSCP نیز به‌طور انحصاری در قالب CAT ارائه خواهند شد. تا آن زمان، این آزمون‌ها همچنان در قالب سنتی نیز در دسترس خواهند بود.hashtag#آکادمی_روزبه ارائه دهنده دوره آمادگی آزمون رسمی CISSPواتس اپ 09902857290https://lnkd.in/d4x4t5wB

Peyman ZohrevandiPeyman Zohrevandi,,"مدیریت خطاهای زنجیره‌ای در میکروسرویس‌ها | Circuit Breaker با Polly در عملتا حالا شده یه سرویس از کار بیفته و باعث بشه کل سیستم پشت سرش قفل کنه؟ما دقیقاً با همین مشکل روبه‌رو بودیم...توی سیستم‌های میکروسرویسی، گاهی یه خطای ساده مثل دومینو میتونه تمام سرویس‌ها رو پشت‌سر هم از کار بندازه. مخصوصاً وقتی اجرای یک سرویس به پاسخ موفق سرویس بعدی وابسته باشه و درخواست‌ها پشت‌سرهم صف بکشن.💡 اینجا بود که فهمیدیم به مکانیزمی نیاز داریم که بتونه سریعاً جلوی خطاهای پشت‌سرهم رو بگیره و مانع از فشار بیشتر روی کل سیستم بشه.🔌 راه‌حل ما: Circuit Breaker Patternیه مکانیزم طراحی کردیم که:🔸 وقتی یه سرویس چند بار پشت سر هم خطا داد، موقتاً از مدار خارج بشه.🔸 درخواست‌های جدید بهش ارسال نشن و بجاش فوراً به کاربر یه خطای کنترل‌ شده برگردونیم.🔸 بعد از گذشت یه مدت، مدار رو به‌صورت آزمایشی (حالت Half-Open) فعال کنیم تا ببینیم مشکل رفع شده یا نه.🛠️ ابزارمون چی بود؟ Polly (در دات‌نت)برای پیاده‌سازی Circuit Breaker از کتابخونه‌ی Polly استفاده کردیم، که هم قدرتمنده و هم استفاده ازش خیلی راحته. اینجا Polly بهمون کمک کرد:🔹 تعداد خطاهای مجاز و مدت زمان باز بودن مدار رو به‌سادگی تنظیم کنیم.🔹 میشه Circuit Breaker رو با Retry و Timeout ترکیب کنیم تا مدیریت خطاها بهتر بشه.🔹 وضعیت خطاها و مدارها رو دقیق لاگ‌گیری و مانیتور کنیم.🧠 مهم‌ترین تجربه‌ای که به دست آوردیم:✅ همه خطاها Retry نمی‌خوان! بعضی وقت‌ها باید قبول کنیم الان زمان retry نیست، بلکه باید مدار رو قطع کنیم.✅  و Circuit Breaker به ما کمک کرد که: 🔹 جلوی overload شدن سرویس‌های مشکل‌دار رو بگیریم. 🔹 بقیه‌ی بخش‌های سیستم رو پایدار نگه داریم. 🔹 خطاها رو ساده‌تر تشخیص بدیم و سریع‌تر واکنش نشون بدیم.📌 نکته مهم: پس Circuit Breaker فقط یه ابزار نیست، یه نگرشه که کمک میکنه طراحی سیستم‌مون از اساس resilient بشه. یعنی بپذیریم که «خطا همیشه وجود داره»، ولی ما می‌تونیم مدیریتش کنیم.❓ شما از Circuit Breaker استفاده کردید؟ با Polly تجربه‌ای داشتید، یا از ابزارهای دیگه استفاده کردید؟ خیلی خوشحال میشم نظرتون رو بدونم 🙌hashtag#Microservices hashtag#CircuitBreaker hashtag#Polly hashtag#Resilience hashtag#FaultTolerance hashtag#DistributedSystems hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#SystemDesign hashtag#Scalability

HardFault IndiaHardFault India,,Diving Deep into OpenThread Architecture for STM32WB
James JohnJames John,,"""Yes, I still program in C when necessary. Why? Speed. And because it talks natively to the OS.""Let me explain with a real-world example:I recently built a real-time WebSocket server to act as a multiplexer for users across multiple connections—similar to how WhatsApp syncs messages between your phone and desktop browser in real-time.✅ When a message is sent or received, it broadcasts instantly to all connected devices.✅ But the challenge? The core project was in PHP—and I needed real-time messaging without switching stacks.I tried PHP CLI to build the server, but hit a wall:• No official multithreading support• I had to rely on fork()—which creates a new process (slow & resource-heavy)• And worse: sockets couldn’t be shared across processesHere’s the problem:Imagine your phone is connected on Process A, your laptop on Process B.When a message arrives for your phone, Process A can’t access Process B’s socket to forward it.That’s when I turned to C.With C:• I implemented threads (sharing resources within a single process)• The socket file descriptors remained accessible across threads• I could handle each connection in its own thread, linked to the authenticated userHow? 👉 I implemented the RFC 6455 WebSocket spec for the handshake 👉 Then authenticated each connection by calling back to the PHP app (using the HTTP cookie) 👉 PHP responded with a success status and user ID, which I used to track connectionsThe result: a blazing fast, multi-threaded WebSocket server written in C, integrated seamlessly with PHP.In my next post, I’ll cover how I used IPC to connect C and PHP, and how I grouped connections in a hashmap + linked list for efficient broadcasting.👉 Curious about the challenges of mixing C and PHP in real-time systems?

Adding such a Authorization proxy can simplify what people can see in the sense of being able to drill down to more than just label==prom-label-proxy value...I've recorded a short demo showing two interfaces (Grafana & Perses) accessing a centralized Prometheus Store without any tenancy knowledge. The Queries shown are taken, examined (and since I run no tenancy, remove the tenant= label) and processed with the backend. In the functional query (rate, implemented as Feature policy meaning you can enable/disable features like that per policy) the permissions for the user executing need to be satisfied on any provided parameter and further more also on any returned metric label (which why the same query with switching tenant=namespace1 to namespace=superuser reveals an additional label metric as namespace1 lacks permissions to view /daniel as label path in the metric requests_total.I am trying to push a POC for everyone to be evaluated soon but right now any additional ideas you can think of are highly appreciated ...

Alyona TolstovaAlyona Tolstova,,"Let’s talk about work-life balance – or better yet, work-life harmony.Working remotely, I’ve come to appreciate that the traditional 9-to-6 mindset doesn’t always apply when you genuinely enjoy your job and work with a trust-based employer. Instead of drawing hard lines between “work” and “personal life,” I’ve almost found a rhythm that blends both.Here’s what it looks like for me:💡 Some weekends, inspiration strikes. An article idea clicks, or I finally see a way to tighten that copy I’ve been mulling over. And you know what? I dive in – because I want to, not because I have to. There's no pressure, just the satisfaction of capturing ideas when they're fresh and flowing.💡 Then there are weekdays when I might work late – not out of obligation, but because I’m in the zone, or I’m handling a high-impact project that excites me. The sense of purpose and ownership makes it feel less like overtime, and more like building something that matters.💡 And yes, I also take breaks in the middle of the day. I might step out for a walk with my dog or take my laptop to a café. The flexibility to live life alongside work – not around it, is empowering. What makes this harmony possible? A few things:👌 I genuinely love what I do.👌 I work in a company with a supportive and caring culture.👌 There’s a shared understanding of trust, responsibility, and results in my team.Remote work has changed the landscape, but mindset matters more than location. For those of us who thrive on creativity, autonomy, and purpose, work-life harmony isn’t just a buzzword – it’s a sustainable way of working.Curious to hear: How do you blend work and life in your own routine?P.S. This is my dog Zara on the pic, and she kindly reminds me that it's time to go out and clear the head 😁

Charles MasonCharles Mason,,"Designation Notice – Continuity Base AlphaThe Old Viscose Plant, Garden City – Roanoke, VAEffective May 10, 2025Today, the Tier 0 Continuity Authority formally designates the historic Viscose Plant site in Garden City as Continuity Base Alpha — the national fusion node for emergency rail response, cybersecurity, and continuity-grade energy command.This is not a property claim — it’s a designation of national continuity function. We’re not claiming land. We’re anchoring readiness.We’re not asking for land. We’re offering readiness — mapped, structured, and built on Roanoke’s legacy.Roanoke once fueled the nation. It now protects it.From this site, we envision:1.     A Tier 0-grade Rail Cybersecurity & SCADA Isolation Command2.     Emergency Rail Response Force (ERRF) Staging and Dispatch3.     A hybrid cloud Tier 0 data center (air-gapped from the open internet — but connected to trusted local, state, federal, and command-grade networks. Designed for 9x9 uptime. No breach. No doomscroll. Just dispatch)4.     High-speed rail + light rail continuity testing ground5.     Grid-tied resilience via APCO + river cooling loopVirginia Tech — your SCADA research, continuity innovation, and cybersecurity depth will shape what we build here.

Omkar ModiOmkar Modi,,"🎯 Today's Java Learning : Mastering Strings📌 I explored one of the most essential topics in Java Strings.Here's what i learned :🚀What is String in Java?A sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text. In Java, String is a class, not a primitive datatype.🚀Why String is Non-Primitive?Because it is an object of the String Class, offering methods and functionalities unlike Primitive type.🚀How Many Ways to Declare String in Java ?🎯There are Mainly Three Ways are Present to Declare String in Java 1. String Class (Immutable) 2. String Buffer (Mutable, Thread-Safe, Slow) 3. StringBuilder (Mutable, Non-Thread-Safe, It is faster than String Buffer)🎯How Many Ways to Declare String Class in Java ? So, there are Basically Two Ways are Present  to Declare String Class in Java. 1. String Literal(String Literal are always Stored in SCP Area) ex. String S1 = ""Omkar""; 2. By Using New Keyword(Which is Stored in Heap Area) ex. String S1 = new String(""Java"")📌First, We know what is SCP Area ?SCP area in String is a Special Memory Location where we can Store String Literals only.📌Why Always String literal Better than by Using New Keyword ?✅ Reuses object from String Constant Pool (SCP)✅ Saves Memory✅ Improves Performance🚀Heap Area vs SCP Area In Heap Area By Using new Keyword it makes two object mainly first create in Heap Area and second it check String Literal which is Present or not  in SCP Area if String Literal not found there then it create second object in S  SCP Area.🚀 Why String is immutable ? ✅Ensures Security and thread-safety. ✅Once created, It's value can not be changed. ✅Any modification creates new object. 🔒 Why String Class is Final ? ✅ It Prevents Overriding methods like hashcode () and equals() method.✅Ensures consistent behavior across JVM.hashtag#StringinJava hashtag#JavaLearninghashtag#JavaString hashtag#HeapMemory#StringPool#SoftwareDevelopment#JavaDeveloper

Shivani WakdeShivani Wakde,,"🚀 Why Logging Is a Developer's Best Friend – Especially for Java Devs ☕In the fast-paced world of software development, logging isn't just about printing messages, it's about observability, debugging, performance monitoring, and security.🔍 Why Logging Matters:• Diagnoses production issues without stepping through code• Provides a clear audit trail for compliance and security• Identifies performance bottlenecks• Helps track user behavior and application flow🛠️ Best Practices to Follow While Logging:✅ Use Logging Frameworks like SLF4J + Logback or Log4j2Avoid System.out.println; it's not scalable or manageable.🧭 Use Appropriate Log LevelsERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE – use them intentionally to avoid noise.🔐 Never Log Sensitive DataKeep personal info, credentials, and tokens out of logs.⚡ Use Parameterized LoggingAvoid string concatenation; use {} placeholders to enhance performance.📄 Keep Logs StructuredUse JSON or key-value pairs, so logs are machine-parsable and searchable (works well with ELK, Splunk, etc.).🧠 Add Context to LogsInclude user ID, request ID, session ID, or any business key to make logs actionable.🗂️ Organize Logs by Domain, Module, or WorkflowLogging per business domain or workflow (like OrderService, InvoiceProcessing) enables faster issue localization.📦 Log Exceptions with Stack TracesDon’t swallow exceptions—log the stack trace to trace the root cause easily.🚦 Avoid Logging Too Verbosely in ProductionEnable only necessary log levels (like INFO and ERROR) in prod. DEBUG should be reserved for dev/staging.📊 Integrate with Monitoring & Alerting ToolsStream logs to observability tools like ELK, Grafana, or Prometheus. Set alerts for specific error patterns.🌐 Correlate Logs Across MicroservicesUse correlation/request IDs to track a single user request across multiple services.♻️ Rotate & Archive LogsManage log file size with rotation policies to avoid disk space issues.
