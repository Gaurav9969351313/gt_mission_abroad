Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there.

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Srikanth HemmigeSrikanth Hemmige,,"hashtag#FreshStartTip – Understanding Talent Acquisition vs. HRAs part of my small initiative to share whatever little I've learned in my career from the HR Tech industry so far, here’s a quick tip that might help freshers and those new to the corporate world—especially if you're exploring roles or networking in the HR Tech space.One of the most common mix-ups I’ve seen  is confusing Talent Acquisition with Human Resources (HR).While they work closely together, their core responsibilities are different:Talent Acquisition (TA) is all about:1. Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Srikanth HemmigeSrikanth Hemmige,,"hashtag#FreshStartTip – Understanding Talent Acquisition vs. HRAs part of my small initiative to share whatever little I've learned in my career from the HR Tech industry so far, here’s a quick tip that might help freshers and those new to the corporate world—especially if you're exploring roles or networking in the HR Tech space.One of the most common mix-ups I’ve seen  is confusing Talent Acquisition with Human Resources (HR).While they work closely together, their core responsibilities are different:Talent Acquisition (TA) is all about:1. Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Srikanth HemmigeSrikanth Hemmige,,"hashtag#FreshStartTip – Understanding Talent Acquisition vs. HRAs part of my small initiative to share whatever little I've learned in my career from the HR Tech industry so far, here’s a quick tip that might help freshers and those new to the corporate world—especially if you're exploring roles or networking in the HR Tech space.One of the most common mix-ups I’ve seen  is confusing Talent Acquisition with Human Resources (HR).While they work closely together, their core responsibilities are different:Talent Acquisition (TA) is all about:1. Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Srikanth HemmigeSrikanth Hemmige,,"hashtag#FreshStartTip – Understanding Talent Acquisition vs. HRAs part of my small initiative to share whatever little I've learned in my career from the HR Tech industry so far, here’s a quick tip that might help freshers and those new to the corporate world—especially if you're exploring roles or networking in the HR Tech space.One of the most common mix-ups I’ve seen  is confusing Talent Acquisition with Human Resources (HR).While they work closely together, their core responsibilities are different:Talent Acquisition (TA) is all about:1. Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Data Collection SpecialistThese posts often lack:Specific job details.Legitimate application links.Any semblance of authenticity.Instead, they're fishing for:Your name.Your email.Your aspirations.All to later pitch you dubious courses or products.But It's Not Just About EngagementSome scams go further. For instance, certain fraudulent job postings have been linked to malware distribution. (Digit)Stay Sharp, Job SeekersBefore you comment ""Interested"":Verify the company's official job postings.Be wary of vague job descriptions.Never download unfamiliar apps or click on suspicious links.Remember, LinkedIn is a professional network, not a dating app. A pretty face doesn't guarantee a genuine opportunity.hashtag#Accenture hashtag#Deloitte hashtag#Amazon hashtag#Google hashtag#TCS hashtag#HCLTech hashtag#Wipro hashtag#Cognizant hashtag#Capgemini hashtag#IBM hashtag#Infosys hashtag#Oracle hashtag#DellTechnologies hashtag#Apple hashtag#NotHiringJustSmiling hashtag#LinkedInScam hashtag#FreshersBeware hashtag#PrettyPostNoPaycheck hashtag#DataFarming101 hashtag#FakeProfile

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Srikanth HemmigeSrikanth Hemmige,,"hashtag#FreshStartTip – Understanding Talent Acquisition vs. HRAs part of my small initiative to share whatever little I've learned in my career from the HR Tech industry so far, here’s a quick tip that might help freshers and those new to the corporate world—especially if you're exploring roles or networking in the HR Tech space.One of the most common mix-ups I’ve seen  is confusing Talent Acquisition with Human Resources (HR).While they work closely together, their core responsibilities are different:Talent Acquisition (TA) is all about:1. Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Their participation in the workforce has increased by 23 per cent compared to the first quarter of 2024. Out of the record-breaking 1.8 crore job applications received in Q1 of 2025 form, 62 lakh were from women reveals the ‘India at Work – Q1 2025’ report by the jobs platform, Apna. This is 30 per cent more than 2024. About 66 lakh applications were received from freshers, which is 46 per cent more than was seen during the same time last year.Interestingly, there was a 92 per cent increase in the number of women applying for enterprise roles. What is even more interesting is that the numbers are steadily growing in Indore, Chandigarh, Jamshedpur and other tier-2 and 3 cities. The reason for these encouraging numbers is the availability of flexible work options in addition to gender-inclusive hiring, and expanded opportunities in BPOs, finance companies, and the human-resources domain. Even more interesting is the fact that the maximum number of jobs (2.1 lakh) was posted by small and medium businesses or SMBs. Of these, 28,547 roles were exclusively for women. Enterprise hiring surged with companies such as Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), Paytm, Delhivery and Flipkart posting more than one lakh openings, reaching out to talent beyond the metros. Jobs were created across more than 900 cities.More and more companies are recruiting from beyond the metros now, from cities such as Lucknow, Jaipur, Indore, Meerut, Rajkot and Warangal. These cities have witnessed a 30-50 per cent year-on-year growth in tech job applications, driven by increased access to engineering talent, certifications and stronger digital infrastructure. The rise of remote-first work models has further enabled these cities to tap into a broader pool of tech professionals.The surge in job applications is proof of the country’s growing economic optimism and digital hiring boom across sectors, says the report.Are there enough jobs available? The platform saw 3.1 lakh job postings, which is 26 per cent more than the number posted during the first quarter of 2024.The demand for tech talent with advanced skills is also rising. In fact, Q1 saw a 65.4 per cent rise in job postings for software and web developer roles, with a 42.2 per cent rise in fresher applications for these roles. So, yes, India is transforming digitally.

Sourcing, attracting & hiring top talent2. Planning future workforce needs3. Employer branding & recruitment marketingHuman Resources (HR) focuses on:1. Managing employees post-hire2. Handling payroll, policies, and compliance3. Driving engagement, growth, and retentionTA gets you in the door. HR helps you grow inside !! 🚀Understanding this can help you communicate more effectively and build stronger connections within the HR Tech community and broader professional network. !!If you’ve had moments of mixing these up, don’t worry—we’ve all been there. Let’s keep learning and sharing!Hope this helps at least one person out there—that’s a win for me!hashtag#FreshStartTip hashtag#HRTech hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#HumanResources hashtag#CareerLearning hashtag#HelpingFreshers hashtag#PeopleOps hashtag#EntryLevelTips hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CustomerSuccess

Their participation in the workforce has increased by 23 per cent compared to the first quarter of 2024. Out of the record-breaking 1.8 crore job applications received in Q1 of 2025 form, 62 lakh were from women reveals the ‘India at Work – Q1 2025’ report by the jobs platform, Apna. This is 30 per cent more than 2024. About 66 lakh applications were received from freshers, which is 46 per cent more than was seen during the same time last year.Interestingly, there was a 92 per cent increase in the number of women applying for enterprise roles. What is even more interesting is that the numbers are steadily growing in Indore, Chandigarh, Jamshedpur and other tier-2 and 3 cities. The reason for these encouraging numbers is the availability of flexible work options in addition to gender-inclusive hiring, and expanded opportunities in BPOs, finance companies, and the human-resources domain. Even more interesting is the fact that the maximum number of jobs (2.1 lakh) was posted by small and medium businesses or SMBs. Of these, 28,547 roles were exclusively for women. Enterprise hiring surged with companies such as Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), Paytm, Delhivery and Flipkart posting more than one lakh openings, reaching out to talent beyond the metros. Jobs were created across more than 900 cities.More and more companies are recruiting from beyond the metros now, from cities such as Lucknow, Jaipur, Indore, Meerut, Rajkot and Warangal. These cities have witnessed a 30-50 per cent year-on-year growth in tech job applications, driven by increased access to engineering talent, certifications and stronger digital infrastructure. The rise of remote-first work models has further enabled these cities to tap into a broader pool of tech professionals.The surge in job applications is proof of the country’s growing economic optimism and digital hiring boom across sectors, says the report.Are there enough jobs available? The platform saw 3.1 lakh job postings, which is 26 per cent more than the number posted during the first quarter of 2024.The demand for tech talent with advanced skills is also rising. In fact, Q1 saw a 65.4 per cent rise in job postings for software and web developer roles, with a 42.2 per cent rise in fresher applications for these roles. So, yes, India is transforming digitally.
