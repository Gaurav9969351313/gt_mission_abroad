Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Ronanki ManikantaRonanki Manikanta,,"The Art of Anticipatory Luxury at Conrad DubaiAt Conrad Dubai, we believe true luxury lies in the details—those thoughtful, unexpected touches that transform a stay into an unforgettable experience. Recently, my team noticed a guest’s sunglasses and laptop in the room and immediately took action. Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things. It made all the difference.""This is the essence of Conrad Dubai: not just meeting expectations, but exceeding them with intuitive, personalized service.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest.

Recently, my team noticed a guest’s sunglasses and laptop in the room and immediately took action. Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things. It made all the difference.""This is the essence of Conrad Dubai: not just meeting expectations, but exceeding them with intuitive, personalized service.

Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest.

Recently, my team noticed a guest’s sunglasses and laptop in the room and immediately took action. Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things. It made all the difference.""This is the essence of Conrad Dubai: not just meeting expectations, but exceeding them with intuitive, personalized service.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Recently, my team noticed a guest’s sunglasses and laptop in the room and immediately took action. Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things. It made all the difference.""This is the essence of Conrad Dubai: not just meeting expectations, but exceeding them with intuitive, personalized service.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Even at 2 a.m.,,the streets are alive as if the evening has just begun..Families with young children, women walking alone or in groups, and friends hanging out without a single worry. There’s a deep sense of security and peace that allows residents and tourists to enjoy life freely at any hour. The presence of a strong legal system, advanced surveillance, and a zero-tolerance approach to crime plays a big role in this environment.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Valeriya ZaychukValeriya Zaychuk,,"When everyone still asking WHY I belive in UAE & MENA as a future, here the answers: ✅ UAE one of a very few countries in the world, where TOP leaders are not corrupt to take away from people, or destroy economies BUT choose to add value to their people and build for all the future generations ✅UAE invest into the future, not past. Hence it keeps changing, adapting and growing super fast by adding a NEW tech, innovations and new instruments for growth & development ✅UAE values those who add value for others - they invest ONLY into success stories on a global scale. They are not running after the hype, instead support true builders of new economies ✅UAE have its own rules, own values, and its own vision/plan for the future being ONE of the countries these days, who KNOWs what they want to achieve by 2040 and execute it daily. ✅ UAE knows the value of strong community hence they created the environment that attracts the smartest, the richest and most talented individuals; if not as residents, then as investors, contributors and partners.

Even at 2 a.m.,,the streets are alive as if the evening has just begun..Families with young children, women walking alone or in groups, and friends hanging out without a single worry. There’s a deep sense of security and peace that allows residents and tourists to enjoy life freely at any hour. The presence of a strong legal system, advanced surveillance, and a zero-tolerance approach to crime plays a big role in this environment. Public spaces are clean, well-lit, and constantly monitored, making people feel safe whether they’re dining out late, taking a walk by the beach, or shopping at 24-hour outlets.In a world where safety is often a luxury, Dubai has made it the norm and that’s what truly sets it apart…..

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Zeeshan NoorZeeshan Noor,,"The UAE job market in 2025 is showing strong growth, with around 69% of employers planning to hire, particularly in tech, healthcare, finance, and tourism. As the economy expands, roles in AI, cybersecurity, nursing, and regulatory finance are in high demand, with competitive salaries and opportunities for advancement. A shift toward skills-based hiring is reshaping recruitment, and nearly 73% of professionals are open to job changes, driven by a desire for better benefits and career growth. However, increased competition from a rising expat workforce is prompting companies to be more selective, making upskilling and strategic networking more important than ever.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Hence it keeps changing, adapting and growing super fast by adding a NEW tech, innovations and new instruments for growth & development ✅UAE values those who add value for others - they invest ONLY into success stories on a global scale. They are not running after the hype, instead support true builders of new economies ✅UAE have its own rules, own values, and its own vision/plan for the future being ONE of the countries these days, who KNOWs what they want to achieve by 2040 and execute it daily. ✅ UAE knows the value of strong community hence they created the environment that attracts the smartest, the richest and most talented individuals; if not as residents, then as investors, contributors and partners.

Even at 2 a.m.,,the streets are alive as if the evening has just begun..Families with young children, women walking alone or in groups, and friends hanging out without a single worry. There’s a deep sense of security and peace that allows residents and tourists to enjoy life freely at any hour.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

However, increased competition from a rising expat workforce is prompting companies to be more selective, making upskilling and strategic networking more important than ever.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Hence it keeps changing, adapting and growing super fast by adding a NEW tech, innovations and new instruments for growth & development ✅UAE values those who add value for others - they invest ONLY into success stories on a global scale. They are not running after the hype, instead support true builders of new economies ✅UAE have its own rules, own values, and its own vision/plan for the future being ONE of the countries these days, who KNOWs what they want to achieve by 2040 and execute it daily. ✅ UAE knows the value of strong community hence they created the environment that attracts the smartest, the richest and most talented individuals; if not as residents, then as investors, contributors and partners.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Manaf UddinManaf Uddin,,"Safety in Dubai is truly unmatched, and it’s one of the city’s most remarkable qualities. Even at 2 a.m.,,the streets are alive as if the evening has just begun..Families with young children, women walking alone or in groups, and friends hanging out without a single worry. There’s a deep sense of security and peace that allows residents and tourists to enjoy life freely at any hour. The presence of a strong legal system, advanced surveillance, and a zero-tolerance approach to crime plays a big role in this environment. Public spaces are clean, well-lit, and constantly monitored, making people feel safe whether they’re dining out late, taking a walk by the beach, or shopping at 24-hour outlets.In a world where safety is often a luxury, Dubai has made it the norm and that’s what truly sets it apart…..

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest.

With platforms like Noon and Amazon becoming household names, the market has seen exponential growth, especially in sectors like fashion, electronics, and food delivery.Opportunities for EntrepreneursThe UAE offers an ideal environment for e-commerce startups, with attractive tax policies and a business-friendly infrastructure. Free zones like Dubai Internet City and Jebel Ali are magnets for digital entrepreneurs. Women-led startups are also reshaping the industry, with innovative businesses across fashion, beauty, and digital services.Challenges for E-Commerce FoundersWhile the opportunities are abundant, challenges persist. Global players like Amazon and Noon dominate, making it tough for smaller players. Additionally, high digital marketing costs, brand visibility issues, and cultural expectations are barriers to success. Businesses must focus on trust, quality, and innovation to stay competitive.Key Takeaways •	Customer Experience is King: Simplified, fast service builds loyalty. •	Niche Wins: Unique positioning helps small brands stand out. •	Consistency & Adaptability: Be ready to pivot based on data and trends.Looking AheadThe future of UAE’s e-commerce will be shaped by technology—AI, AR, cross-border selling, and fintech integration.

Reza JilaniReza Jilani,,"⚽️ Global Football x Dubai Real Estate: A Strategic ConvergenceThe recent collaboration between DAMAC Properties and Chelsea Football Club marks a significant turning point:international sports brands are no longer limited to media and merchandise — they are entering the world of real estate.This partnership is not just about sponsorship. It reflects a broader trend:Dubai is positioning itself as a global hub where luxury real estate, capital investment, and global sports intersect.From lifestyle integration to experiential developments, the region is aligning property with culture, emotion, and identity.As a real estate advisor, I see this as a long-term signal:the boundaries between asset classes, lifestyle, and entertainment are rapidly dissolving in the UAE.️ پیوند استراتژیک فوتبال جهانی و بازار املاک دبیهمکاری اخیر میان شرکت داماک و باشگاه فوتبال چلسی انگلستان،نقطه عطفی در ورود برندهای ورزشی بین‌المللی به حوزه‌هایی فراتر از رسانه و تبلیغات است:اکنون فوتبال جهانی وارد بازار املاک لوکس شده است.این مشارکت صرفاً یک اسپانسرشیپ نیست،بلکه نشان‌دهنده روندی جدید است که در آن دبی به‌عنوان مرکز اتصال بین سرمایه، سبک زندگی و برندهای جهانی در حال تثبیت جایگاه خود است.ترکیب املاک با تجربه‌های فرهنگی، احساسی و شخصی،در حال شکل‌دهی آینده‌ای‌ست که در آن، مرز میان دارایی، تفریح و زندگی روزمره در حال محو شدن است.به‌عنوان مشاور فعال در بازار املاک دبی،این تحول را سیگنالی بلندمدت می‌دانم برای تغییرات ساختاری در مدل سرمایه‌گذاری آینده.DAMACxChelseahashtag#DubaiRealEstatehashtag#SportsAndRealEstatehashtag#GlobalPartnershiphashtag#MiddleEastBusinesshashtag#RealEstateStrategyhashtag#LuxuryDevelopmenthashtag#FootballBusinesshashtag#LifestyleBrandinghashtag#ChelseaFChashtag#DamacPropertieshashtag#UrbanInvestmenthashtag#LiveDubaihashtag#SportAndCapitalhashtag#UAERealEstatehashtag#RezaJilanihashtag#StrategicPartnershipshashtag#MarketInsightshashtag#EmergingTrendshashtag#FutureOfLiving

Ronanki ManikantaRonanki Manikanta,,"The Art of Anticipatory Luxury at Conrad DubaiAt Conrad Dubai, we believe true luxury lies in the details—those thoughtful, unexpected touches that transform a stay into an unforgettable experience. Recently, my team noticed a guest’s sunglasses and laptop in the room and immediately took action. Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things. It made all the difference.""This is the essence of Conrad Dubai: not just meeting expectations, but exceeding them with intuitive, personalized service.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Hence it keeps changing, adapting and growing super fast by adding a NEW tech, innovations and new instruments for growth & development ✅UAE values those who add value for others - they invest ONLY into success stories on a global scale. They are not running after the hype, instead support true builders of new economies ✅UAE have its own rules, own values, and its own vision/plan for the future being ONE of the countries these days, who KNOWs what they want to achieve by 2040 and execute it daily. ✅ UAE knows the value of strong community hence they created the environment that attracts the smartest, the richest and most talented individuals; if not as residents, then as investors, contributors and partners.

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Alex AbazidisAlex Abazidis,,"Россияне скупают недвижимость в Дубае. Арабы же напротив, инвестируют в недвижимость Греции. Есть такое греческое слово- παράδοξος. Слово которое очень часто упоминается в России. По - русски, парадокс переводится как: неожиданный, странный… И действительно, странный выбор - Эмираты. Я по другому никак не могу охарактеризовать - стремление россиян, инвестировать в «человейники». Кстати, я в Москве впервые услышал это забавное слово «человейник» 😂. Именно так, кто-то в шутку прозвал столичные многоэтажки. К небоскрёбам в Дубае, идеально подходит👍Понятно что на вкус и цвет - товарищей нет. Но разве можно сравнить дом у моря в Греции, с панорамным видом на залив или горы, покрытые оливковыми садами? И раскалённые от жары стекляшки, устремлённые вверх, в никуда… Где ни детям вашим - на земле погулять, поиграть, побеситься. Ни самим вдоль моря по тёплому песочку пройтись. Вдыхая полной грудью - чистый морской воздух. А про плавание в бирюзовой воде? Ну где, в каком Эмирате вы найдёте подобное?! А в Греции найдёте. И это мы ещё до греческой кухни не добрались. Словом, вы знаете кому звонить - по поиску греческой недвижимости 🏠 😊На связи. Всегда.hashtag#подписчики Russians are buying up real estate in Dubai. Arabs, on the contrary, are investing in real estate in Greece. There is such a Greek word - παράδοξος. A word that is often mentioned in Russia. In Russian, paradox is translated as: unexpected, strange ... And indeed, a strange choice - the Emirates.I can’t describe it any other way - the desire of Russians to invest in ""human anthills"". By the way, I first heard this funny word ""human anthill"" in Moscow 😂. That's exactly how someone jokingly called the capital's high-rise buildings. It fits perfectly with the skyscrapers in Dubai 👍It is clear that there are no comrades for taste and color. But can you compare a house by the sea in Greece with a panoramic view of the bay or mountains covered with olive groves? And the hot glass pieces, directed upwards, into nowhere...Where not for your children - to walk on the ground, play, have fun. Not for you to walk along the sea on the warm sand. Breathing in the clean sea air. And about swimming in turquoise water? Well, where, in which Emirate will you find something like that?! But in Greece you will find it. And we haven't even gotten to Greek cuisine yet.In short, you know who to call - to search for Greek real estate 🏠 😊In touch.Always.hashtag#greekland

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Alex AbazidisAlex Abazidis,,"Россияне скупают недвижимость в Дубае. Арабы же напротив, инвестируют в недвижимость Греции. Есть такое греческое слово- παράδοξος. Слово которое очень часто упоминается в России. По - русски, парадокс переводится как: неожиданный, странный… И действительно, странный выбор - Эмираты. Я по другому никак не могу охарактеризовать - стремление россиян, инвестировать в «человейники». Кстати, я в Москве впервые услышал это забавное слово «человейник» 😂. Именно так, кто-то в шутку прозвал столичные многоэтажки. К небоскрёбам в Дубае, идеально подходит👍Понятно что на вкус и цвет - товарищей нет. Но разве можно сравнить дом у моря в Греции, с панорамным видом на залив или горы, покрытые оливковыми садами? И раскалённые от жары стекляшки, устремлённые вверх, в никуда… Где ни детям вашим - на земле погулять, поиграть, побеситься. Ни самим вдоль моря по тёплому песочку пройтись. Вдыхая полной грудью - чистый морской воздух. А про плавание в бирюзовой воде? Ну где, в каком Эмирате вы найдёте подобное?! А в Греции найдёте. И это мы ещё до греческой кухни не добрались. Словом, вы знаете кому звонить - по поиску греческой недвижимости 🏠 😊На связи. Всегда.hashtag#подписчики Russians are buying up real estate in Dubai. Arabs, on the contrary, are investing in real estate in Greece. There is such a Greek word - παράδοξος. A word that is often mentioned in Russia. In Russian, paradox is translated as: unexpected, strange ... And indeed, a strange choice - the Emirates.I can’t describe it any other way - the desire of Russians to invest in ""human anthills"". By the way, I first heard this funny word ""human anthill"" in Moscow 😂. That's exactly how someone jokingly called the capital's high-rise buildings. It fits perfectly with the skyscrapers in Dubai 👍It is clear that there are no comrades for taste and color. But can you compare a house by the sea in Greece with a panoramic view of the bay or mountains covered with olive groves? And the hot glass pieces, directed upwards, into nowhere...Where not for your children - to walk on the ground, play, have fun. Not for you to walk along the sea on the warm sand. Breathing in the clean sea air. And about swimming in turquoise water? Well, where, in which Emirate will you find something like that?! But in Greece you will find it. And we haven't even gotten to Greek cuisine yet.In short, you know who to call - to search for Greek real estate 🏠 😊In touch.Always.hashtag#greekland

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Alex AbazidisAlex Abazidis,,"Россияне скупают недвижимость в Дубае. Арабы же напротив, инвестируют в недвижимость Греции. Есть такое греческое слово- παράδοξος. Слово которое очень часто упоминается в России. По - русски, парадокс переводится как: неожиданный, странный… И действительно, странный выбор - Эмираты. Я по другому никак не могу охарактеризовать - стремление россиян, инвестировать в «человейники». Кстати, я в Москве впервые услышал это забавное слово «человейник» 😂. Именно так, кто-то в шутку прозвал столичные многоэтажки. К небоскрёбам в Дубае, идеально подходит👍Понятно что на вкус и цвет - товарищей нет. Но разве можно сравнить дом у моря в Греции, с панорамным видом на залив или горы, покрытые оливковыми садами? И раскалённые от жары стекляшки, устремлённые вверх, в никуда… Где ни детям вашим - на земле погулять, поиграть, побеситься. Ни самим вдоль моря по тёплому песочку пройтись. Вдыхая полной грудью - чистый морской воздух. А про плавание в бирюзовой воде? Ну где, в каком Эмирате вы найдёте подобное?! А в Греции найдёте. И это мы ещё до греческой кухни не добрались. Словом, вы знаете кому звонить - по поиску греческой недвижимости 🏠 😊На связи. Всегда.hashtag#подписчики Russians are buying up real estate in Dubai. Arabs, on the contrary, are investing in real estate in Greece. There is such a Greek word - παράδοξος. A word that is often mentioned in Russia. In Russian, paradox is translated as: unexpected, strange ... And indeed, a strange choice - the Emirates.I can’t describe it any other way - the desire of Russians to invest in ""human anthills"". By the way, I first heard this funny word ""human anthill"" in Moscow 😂. That's exactly how someone jokingly called the capital's high-rise buildings. It fits perfectly with the skyscrapers in Dubai 👍It is clear that there are no comrades for taste and color. But can you compare a house by the sea in Greece with a panoramic view of the bay or mountains covered with olive groves? And the hot glass pieces, directed upwards, into nowhere...Where not for your children - to walk on the ground, play, have fun. Not for you to walk along the sea on the warm sand. Breathing in the clean sea air. And about swimming in turquoise water? Well, where, in which Emirate will you find something like that?! But in Greece you will find it. And we haven't even gotten to Greek cuisine yet.In short, you know who to call - to search for Greek real estate 🏠 😊In touch.Always.hashtag#greekland

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest.

With platforms like Noon and Amazon becoming household names, the market has seen exponential growth, especially in sectors like fashion, electronics, and food delivery.Opportunities for EntrepreneursThe UAE offers an ideal environment for e-commerce startups, with attractive tax policies and a business-friendly infrastructure. Free zones like Dubai Internet City and Jebel Ali are magnets for digital entrepreneurs. Women-led startups are also reshaping the industry, with innovative businesses across fashion, beauty, and digital services.Challenges for E-Commerce FoundersWhile the opportunities are abundant, challenges persist. Global players like Amazon and Noon dominate, making it tough for smaller players. Additionally, high digital marketing costs, brand visibility issues, and cultural expectations are barriers to success. Businesses must focus on trust, quality, and innovation to stay competitive.Key Takeaways •	Customer Experience is King: Simplified, fast service builds loyalty. •	Niche Wins: Unique positioning helps small brands stand out. •	Consistency & Adaptability: Be ready to pivot based on data and trends.Looking AheadThe future of UAE’s e-commerce will be shaped by technology—AI, AR, cross-border selling, and fintech integration.

Reza JilaniReza Jilani,,"⚽️ Global Football x Dubai Real Estate: A Strategic ConvergenceThe recent collaboration between DAMAC Properties and Chelsea Football Club marks a significant turning point:international sports brands are no longer limited to media and merchandise — they are entering the world of real estate.This partnership is not just about sponsorship. It reflects a broader trend:Dubai is positioning itself as a global hub where luxury real estate, capital investment, and global sports intersect.From lifestyle integration to experiential developments, the region is aligning property with culture, emotion, and identity.As a real estate advisor, I see this as a long-term signal:the boundaries between asset classes, lifestyle, and entertainment are rapidly dissolving in the UAE.️ پیوند استراتژیک فوتبال جهانی و بازار املاک دبیهمکاری اخیر میان شرکت داماک و باشگاه فوتبال چلسی انگلستان،نقطه عطفی در ورود برندهای ورزشی بین‌المللی به حوزه‌هایی فراتر از رسانه و تبلیغات است:اکنون فوتبال جهانی وارد بازار املاک لوکس شده است.این مشارکت صرفاً یک اسپانسرشیپ نیست،بلکه نشان‌دهنده روندی جدید است که در آن دبی به‌عنوان مرکز اتصال بین سرمایه، سبک زندگی و برندهای جهانی در حال تثبیت جایگاه خود است.ترکیب املاک با تجربه‌های فرهنگی، احساسی و شخصی،در حال شکل‌دهی آینده‌ای‌ست که در آن، مرز میان دارایی، تفریح و زندگی روزمره در حال محو شدن است.به‌عنوان مشاور فعال در بازار املاک دبی،این تحول را سیگنالی بلندمدت می‌دانم برای تغییرات ساختاری در مدل سرمایه‌گذاری آینده.DAMACxChelseahashtag#DubaiRealEstatehashtag#SportsAndRealEstatehashtag#GlobalPartnershiphashtag#MiddleEastBusinesshashtag#RealEstateStrategyhashtag#LuxuryDevelopmenthashtag#FootballBusinesshashtag#LifestyleBrandinghashtag#ChelseaFChashtag#DamacPropertieshashtag#UrbanInvestmenthashtag#LiveDubaihashtag#SportAndCapitalhashtag#UAERealEstatehashtag#RezaJilanihashtag#StrategicPartnershipshashtag#MarketInsightshashtag#EmergingTrendshashtag#FutureOfLiving

Ronanki ManikantaRonanki Manikanta,,"The Art of Anticipatory Luxury at Conrad DubaiAt Conrad Dubai, we believe true luxury lies in the details—those thoughtful, unexpected touches that transform a stay into an unforgettable experience. Recently, my team noticed a guest’s sunglasses and laptop in the room and immediately took action. Without being asked, they placed a premium microfiber cloth beside the devices, ensuring a pristine screen at all times. But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things. It made all the difference.""This is the essence of Conrad Dubai: not just meeting expectations, but exceeding them with intuitive, personalized service.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold. Be informed, be cautious, and ask the right questions before saying yes.hashtag#Dubai hashtag#FreelancerLife hashtag#CareerAdvice hashtag#JobOpportunities hashtag#LivingInDubai hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Immigration hashtag#GoldenVisa hashtag#RealityCheck hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#ExpatLife hashtag#CostOfLiving hashtag#RentalReality hashtag#Utilities hashtag#HardTruths hashtag#ModernSlavery

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Alex AbazidisAlex Abazidis,,"Россияне скупают недвижимость в Дубае. Арабы же напротив, инвестируют в недвижимость Греции. Есть такое греческое слово- παράδοξος. Слово которое очень часто упоминается в России. По - русски, парадокс переводится как: неожиданный, странный… И действительно, странный выбор - Эмираты. Я по другому никак не могу охарактеризовать - стремление россиян, инвестировать в «человейники». Кстати, я в Москве впервые услышал это забавное слово «человейник» 😂. Именно так, кто-то в шутку прозвал столичные многоэтажки. К небоскрёбам в Дубае, идеально подходит👍Понятно что на вкус и цвет - товарищей нет. Но разве можно сравнить дом у моря в Греции, с панорамным видом на залив или горы, покрытые оливковыми садами? И раскалённые от жары стекляшки, устремлённые вверх, в никуда… Где ни детям вашим - на земле погулять, поиграть, побеситься. Ни самим вдоль моря по тёплому песочку пройтись. Вдыхая полной грудью - чистый морской воздух. А про плавание в бирюзовой воде? Ну где, в каком Эмирате вы найдёте подобное?! А в Греции найдёте. И это мы ещё до греческой кухни не добрались. Словом, вы знаете кому звонить - по поиску греческой недвижимости 🏠 😊На связи. Всегда.hashtag#подписчики Russians are buying up real estate in Dubai. Arabs, on the contrary, are investing in real estate in Greece. There is such a Greek word - παράδοξος. A word that is often mentioned in Russia. In Russian, paradox is translated as: unexpected, strange ... And indeed, a strange choice - the Emirates.I can’t describe it any other way - the desire of Russians to invest in ""human anthills"". By the way, I first heard this funny word ""human anthill"" in Moscow 😂. That's exactly how someone jokingly called the capital's high-rise buildings. It fits perfectly with the skyscrapers in Dubai 👍It is clear that there are no comrades for taste and color. But can you compare a house by the sea in Greece with a panoramic view of the bay or mountains covered with olive groves? And the hot glass pieces, directed upwards, into nowhere...Where not for your children - to walk on the ground, play, have fun. Not for you to walk along the sea on the warm sand. Breathing in the clean sea air. And about swimming in turquoise water? Well, where, in which Emirate will you find something like that?! But in Greece you will find it. And we haven't even gotten to Greek cuisine yet.In short, you know who to call - to search for Greek real estate 🏠 😊In touch.Always.hashtag#greekland

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

But he didn’t stop there—He organized the guest’s cables with an elegant cable manager, leaving everything effortlessly tidy. A handwritten note completed the gesture.Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with the guest during his departure. He was genuinely moved by the initiative, saying, ""I was amazed that your team thought this way—no one has ever taken such care with the little things.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Alex AbazidisAlex Abazidis,,"Россияне скупают недвижимость в Дубае. Арабы же напротив, инвестируют в недвижимость Греции. Есть такое греческое слово- παράδοξος. Слово которое очень часто упоминается в России. По - русски, парадокс переводится как: неожиданный, странный… И действительно, странный выбор - Эмираты. Я по другому никак не могу охарактеризовать - стремление россиян, инвестировать в «человейники». Кстати, я в Москве впервые услышал это забавное слово «человейник» 😂. Именно так, кто-то в шутку прозвал столичные многоэтажки. К небоскрёбам в Дубае, идеально подходит👍Понятно что на вкус и цвет - товарищей нет. Но разве можно сравнить дом у моря в Греции, с панорамным видом на залив или горы, покрытые оливковыми садами? И раскалённые от жары стекляшки, устремлённые вверх, в никуда… Где ни детям вашим - на земле погулять, поиграть, побеситься. Ни самим вдоль моря по тёплому песочку пройтись. Вдыхая полной грудью - чистый морской воздух. А про плавание в бирюзовой воде? Ну где, в каком Эмирате вы найдёте подобное?! А в Греции найдёте. И это мы ещё до греческой кухни не добрались. Словом, вы знаете кому звонить - по поиску греческой недвижимости 🏠 😊На связи. Всегда.hashtag#подписчики Russians are buying up real estate in Dubai. Arabs, on the contrary, are investing in real estate in Greece. There is such a Greek word - παράδοξος. A word that is often mentioned in Russia. In Russian, paradox is translated as: unexpected, strange ... And indeed, a strange choice - the Emirates.I can’t describe it any other way - the desire of Russians to invest in ""human anthills"". By the way, I first heard this funny word ""human anthill"" in Moscow 😂. That's exactly how someone jokingly called the capital's high-rise buildings. It fits perfectly with the skyscrapers in Dubai 👍It is clear that there are no comrades for taste and color. But can you compare a house by the sea in Greece with a panoramic view of the bay or mountains covered with olive groves? And the hot glass pieces, directed upwards, into nowhere...Where not for your children - to walk on the ground, play, have fun. Not for you to walk along the sea on the warm sand. Breathing in the clean sea air. And about swimming in turquoise water? Well, where, in which Emirate will you find something like that?! But in Greece you will find it. And we haven't even gotten to Greek cuisine yet.In short, you know who to call - to search for Greek real estate 🏠 😊In touch.Always.hashtag#greekland

Moni GeorgeMoni George,,"Trump-Era Tariffs 2.0: Why Dubai Could Be the Biggest Winner!---------------------------------------------------------------------In 2024, the total bilateral trade between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States reached $34.4 billion, marking a significant increase from previous years. This trade volume comprised $26.9 billion in U.S. exports to the UAE and $7.5 billion in imports from the UAE, resulting in a $19.5 billion trade surplus for the U.S.—its fourth-largest globally.With the potential return of Trump-era tariffs under a “Trump 2.0” administration, the UAE—particularly Dubai—is poised to benefit significantly compared to much of the rest of the world, especially China. As global manufacturers and exporters seek alternative trade routes to bypass high tariffs, Dubai is emerging as a strategic export and re-export hub for Chinese-manufactured goods destined for the U.S. market.This shift positions Dubai not just as a logistics gateway, but as a key trading intermediary between China and the United States, unlocking a new phase of trade growth. In the coming months, this dynamic is expected to fuel unprecedented increases in exports from the UAE to the U.S., as well as reciprocal trade flows.The ripple effects of this transformation will be profound—particularly for Dubai’s real estate sector. The demand for commercial infrastructure, including warehouses, logistics parks, and office spaces, is expected to surge. Simultaneously, the residential market is likely to experience heightened demand, driven by business expansion, workforce inflow, and investor interest. Together, these trends are set to reinforce Dubai’s position as a global trading and real estate hotspot.

Jessyca JoyekurunJessyca Joyekurun,,"Remember The Devil Wears Prada? Dubai is the 2.0 version. Welcome to modern slavery in designer clothes. Since being based here as a freelancer, I've had many people reach out with job offers and opportunities. While this city is known for its glitz and glamour, there are some hard lessons I’ve learned that I think are important for anyone considering a move here.- While Dubai offers perks like zero income tax and attractive salaries, there are some important realities to consider:-Job security can be shaky – you can be terminated without any explanation during your probation period.-Your immigration status is tied to your employment, and unless you have a golden visa, your residency can be at risk if your job ends suddenly.-The cost of living is high, and even with a half a million salary in your country per month, it might not be enough to cover everything.-Accommodation is super expensive, and it’s rarely paid monthly. In most cases, you’ll be expected to pay rent in 1 or worse case 2 instalments – or best, 4 months upfront – plus all your utility bills on top (electricity, water, air con internet, tv etc.). Your employer will not necessarily pay for hotel costs pending you find an accommodation. -Work culture here can be intense – if your boss works 24/7, so will you, as well as other dodgy work conditions that you cannot fight and under constant pressure of potential termination and deportation.-Forget employment rights. Forget human rights.The city might shine, but not everything that glitters is gold.

Business BuzzBusiness Buzz,,"The Dubai real estate market has experienced remarkable growth due to population growth and continued demand, as highlighted by the new industry report. According to ValuStrat, the population reached 3.92 million by March 2025, with 89,695 new residents added in  the first quarter. Demand for living space is rising, leading to an estimated 61,580 new homes expected  this year, with 19% already completed in the first quarter.Residential marketThe Valustrat Price Index (VPI) reports a significant annual increase in residential capital value. Apartments prices rose 21.4%, while villa prices rose 30.3%. Rental prices have also risen, with villa rentals rising 5.1% and housing rents rising 10%. Despite  demand, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure affordable living spaces. The guilt of the whole of the total sin of the Dubai living sector reflects the non-attack between supply and demand, leading to  potential market corrections. In the first quarter of 2025,  sales transactions returned to residential buildings. This was due to fewer mortgage applications than previous quarters.Office marketThe office sector remains robust, with  annual  capital value increasing by 29.1% and research rents increasing by 20.2%. Demand for office space is supported by continuous economic growth and business expansion. The average office rating is AED per 20,591 square meters, which is the highest priced in Dubai city centre.

Alex AbazidisAlex Abazidis,,"Россияне скупают недвижимость в Дубае. Арабы же напротив, инвестируют в недвижимость Греции. Есть такое греческое слово- παράδοξος. Слово которое очень часто упоминается в России. По - русски, парадокс переводится как: неожиданный, странный… И действительно, странный выбор - Эмираты. Я по другому никак не могу охарактеризовать - стремление россиян, инвестировать в «человейники». Кстати, я в Москве впервые услышал это забавное слово «человейник» 😂. Именно так, кто-то в шутку прозвал столичные многоэтажки. К небоскрёбам в Дубае, идеально подходит👍Понятно что на вкус и цвет - товарищей нет. Но разве можно сравнить дом у моря в Греции, с панорамным видом на залив или горы, покрытые оливковыми садами? И раскалённые от жары стекляшки, устремлённые вверх, в никуда… Где ни детям вашим - на земле погулять, поиграть, побеситься. Ни самим вдоль моря по тёплому песочку пройтись. Вдыхая полной грудью - чистый морской воздух. А про плавание в бирюзовой воде? Ну где, в каком Эмирате вы найдёте подобное?! А в Греции найдёте. И это мы ещё до греческой кухни не добрались. Словом, вы знаете кому звонить - по поиску греческой недвижимости 🏠 😊На связи. Всегда.hashtag#подписчики Russians are buying up real estate in Dubai. Arabs, on the contrary, are investing in real estate in Greece. There is such a Greek word - παράδοξος. A word that is often mentioned in Russia. In Russian, paradox is translated as: unexpected, strange ... And indeed, a strange choice - the Emirates.I can’t describe it any other way - the desire of Russians to invest in ""human anthills"". By the way, I first heard this funny word ""human anthill"" in Moscow 😂. That's exactly how someone jokingly called the capital's high-rise buildings. It fits perfectly with the skyscrapers in Dubai 👍It is clear that there are no comrades for taste and color. But can you compare a house by the sea in Greece with a panoramic view of the bay or mountains covered with olive groves? And the hot glass pieces, directed upwards, into nowhere...Where not for your children - to walk on the ground, play, have fun. Not for you to walk along the sea on the warm sand. Breathing in the clean sea air. And about swimming in turquoise water? Well, where, in which Emirate will you find something like that?! But in Greece you will find it. And we haven't even gotten to Greek cuisine yet.In short, you know who to call - to search for Greek real estate 🏠 😊In touch.Always.hashtag#greekland
