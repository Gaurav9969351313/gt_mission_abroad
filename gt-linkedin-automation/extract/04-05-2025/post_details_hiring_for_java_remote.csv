Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Aroosa K.Aroosa K.,,"Balancing work and personal life is no easy task.Even with a carefully planned to-do list, there’s always something left unchecked, a call to return, a workout missed, or a hobby postponed.As someone working a full-time remote job, I’ve experienced both sides of the coin.Many assume remote work is all about comfort, no commute, flexible hours, more time with family. And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Aroosa K.Aroosa K.,,"Balancing work and personal life is no easy task.Even with a carefully planned to-do list, there’s always something left unchecked, a call to return, a workout missed, or a hobby postponed.As someone working a full-time remote job, I’ve experienced both sides of the coin.Many assume remote work is all about comfort, no commute, flexible hours, more time with family. And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Aroosa K.Aroosa K.,,"Balancing work and personal life is no easy task.Even with a carefully planned to-do list, there’s always something left unchecked, a call to return, a workout missed, or a hobby postponed.As someone working a full-time remote job, I’ve experienced both sides of the coin.Many assume remote work is all about comfort, no commute, flexible hours, more time with family. And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

𝐋𝐞𝐭 𝐮𝐬 𝐛𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥!The internet glamorises remote jobs — freedom, travel, work-from-anywhere vibes — but no one really talks about the real challenges, especially for entry-level talents.📌Poor network connection📌Unreliable power supply📌Time zone coordination headaches📌Language barriers📌And let us not forget… the silence after countless client pitches.But the biggest unspoken challenge?Time management.If you can not manage your time, how will you manage a client’s project?Multitasking sounds productive — but in reality, it often leads to half-baked deliverables, burnout, and losing clients. You are better off completing one task well than juggling five poorly.Remote work takes discipline, structure, and a solid mindset — not just a laptop and Wi-Fi.Are you a remote worker or just starting out? What’s one struggle you faced that no one warned you about?Let us talk about the real side of remote life.P.S: Adeife Adeoye thanking for giving entry-level talents a listening ear, that is all they need to be seen.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Aroosa K.Aroosa K.,,"Balancing work and personal life is no easy task.Even with a carefully planned to-do list, there’s always something left unchecked, a call to return, a workout missed, or a hobby postponed.As someone working a full-time remote job, I’ve experienced both sides of the coin.Many assume remote work is all about comfort, no commute, flexible hours, more time with family. And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Aroosa K.Aroosa K.,,"Balancing work and personal life is no easy task.Even with a carefully planned to-do list, there’s always something left unchecked, a call to return, a workout missed, or a hobby postponed.As someone working a full-time remote job, I’ve experienced both sides of the coin.Many assume remote work is all about comfort, no commute, flexible hours, more time with family. And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

Aroosa K.Aroosa K.,,"Balancing work and personal life is no easy task.Even with a carefully planned to-do list, there’s always something left unchecked, a call to return, a workout missed, or a hobby postponed.As someone working a full-time remote job, I’ve experienced both sides of the coin.Many assume remote work is all about comfort, no commute, flexible hours, more time with family. And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Ali HarisAli Haris,,"Here's my latest JavaFX project. The famous card game locally known as 'Daketti'.After often playing with friends till late night, I thought why not code it?Here's are its main features➡️Played between four players with two in each team.➡️Game starts with 4 cards in hand of each player and 4 cards in center.➡️Excessive use of List and Stack data structures.➡️JavaFX Transition classes for animation.➡️Use of OOP principles for a scalable structure.➡️Game result calculation in the end.Currently it is played on a single PC. Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming. Also the code design focuses on all 4 OOP principles, so I have a plan to add some other card games in the collection like (local names) 'Thula', 'Bluff', etc.

Joao MarquesJoao Marques,,"Java 24 just dropped, and I took some of my saturday to dig into the changes compared to Java 23... And I have to say, it’s a solid update. One of the things I was really looking forward to was the finalization of the Foreign Function & Memory API, it basically gives Java a safe, high-performance way to interact with native code and memory, without all the clunky, error creator boilerplate of JNI. You can now allocate off-heap memory, call native libraries, and work with memory segments almost like you're in C, but with Java safety.. I also appreciate how Java 24 is going fr preview features, like unnamed variables and patterns, not sure if they are really usefull, but I like previews, lets test it.On the tooling and performance side, the improvements to the JIT compiler and the enhancements to garbage collection are things I started seeing the impact in some memory-heavy workloads. It feels like Java is becoming a more modern language without losing what made it so stable and reliable in the first place. I’m still cautious about adopting preview features in production, but I like where things are going, it’s like Java is shaking off some of its old weight while staying rock-solid for enterprise apps. I’ll definitely be using Java 24 for side projects just to explore everything more deeply.Oh, almost forgot to mention, if you wanna test the previews, use this:--enable-preview If you’re using intelij, like me, you’ll also need to enable preview features in the project settings.

And yes, it is a blessing in many ways.But it can also be mentally exhausting.When your home is your office, the lines blur. You start replying to emails during dinner, attending meetings from your living room, and slowly, your personal space starts to shrink.Still, I wouldn’t trade the flexibility and freedom for anything.There are many pros and cons of having a WFH job:Pros:✓ No daily commute✓ Better focus (most days!)✓ More family timeCons:• Isolation at times• Work-life boundaries blur• Harder to ""switch off""Here’s what helps me in making my remote job more effective:** Setting clear working hours** Taking breaks seriously (Because rest is also important to improve productivity)** Creating a separate workspace (Most helpful)** Logging off without guilt Working remotely isn’t always easy — but it’s definitely a privilege when balanced right.How do you manage work-life balance while working remotely?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#Productivity hashtag#WFH hashtag#MentalWellness hashtag#LinkedInPost

Elias Ramos GuadalupeElias Ramos Guadalupe,,"One of the most common myths of delocalized work is that coworkers never meet in person. Based on my own experience leading remote teams during my tenure at Microsoft, there are no substitute for meeting face to face with team members. It is actually one of the key elements to make distributed companies work! The meetings are planned and structured to allow people to come together in a way that facilitates connections in working environments where face to face time is not a continuous activity like in an office, but a well prepared and periodical activity.

Future plans are to make it playable on LAN on 4 PC's using java socket programming.
