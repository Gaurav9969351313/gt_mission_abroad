Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Abida Naseer - Career CoachAbida Naseer - Career Coach,,"Job Seekers: Why Your ‘Apply & Pray’ Strategy is Failing in 2025!The job market has changed. But most of you are still using tactics from 2019. We’ve normalized: → Sending the same generic resume to 100 companies (and wondering why no one replies) → Writing LinkedIn headlines like “Unemployed | Looking for Opportunities” → Believing “I’ll figure out the interview when I get one” is a strategy → Calling 3-second ATS scans “unfair” instead of learning to hack them And the result? → Your application gets buried under AI screening tools → Recruiters assume you’re replaceable (because you sound like everyone else) → You settle for roles that underpay your skills → The job hunt feels like shouting into a void This isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about competing in a market where 75% of resumes never reach human eyes. → A resume without quantifiable achievements = background noise → A passive LinkedIn profile = missed recruiter outreach → Zero personal branding = getting lost in the global talent pool Here’s how to flip the script: → Resumes: Write for robots first (ATS keywords), humans second. → LinkedIn: Turn your profile into a “hire me” landing page – not a digital graveyard. → Interviews: Prep 3 STAR stories *before* the call, not during awkward silences. → Salary: Research global rates – don’t let location bias lowball you. The system isn’t broken. It’s evolved. Your job search should too. PS: Remote jobs get 2,500+ applicants in 48 hours. If your materials look average, you ARE average.

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?
