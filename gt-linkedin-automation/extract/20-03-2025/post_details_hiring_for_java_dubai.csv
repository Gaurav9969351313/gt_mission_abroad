NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles. Companies that invest in continuous learning foster loyalty, innovation, and long-term growth.Let’s Discuss!What’s your biggest challenge in Emiratisation?

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

From a first glance, Abu Dhabi’s Value Housing Programme reflects this understanding.If executed well, this initiative can strengthen the city’s talent pipeline, enhance livability, and support business growth. Keen to see how this takes shape.(Views are personal)

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles. Companies that invest in continuous learning foster loyalty, innovation, and long-term growth.Let’s Discuss!What’s your biggest challenge in Emiratisation?

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles. Companies that invest in continuous learning foster loyalty, innovation, and long-term growth.Let’s Discuss!What’s your biggest challenge in Emiratisation?

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles. Companies that invest in continuous learning foster loyalty, innovation, and long-term growth.Let’s Discuss!What’s your biggest challenge in Emiratisation?

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

The Dubai market moves swiftly, and I always stress to my clients the importance of timing—wait too long, and you could miss out on key opportunities.

Justin HarperJustin Harper,,"Maybe you can afford that swanky villa on The Palm after all - or rather a portion of it. Thanks to a new tokenisation project.Dubai Land Department (DLD) has just launched the pilot phase of its 'Real Estate Tokenisation Project' to make it easier to buy and invest in real estate in the Emirate.This is how it works - real estate assets (properties) are converted into digital tokens using blockchain technology. Each property is divided into shares based on an investor’s budget, enabling what is called fractional ownership. Dubai's property market is already booming, with record sales and rising prices. This should give it another boost, allowing you to own a share of a property not the whole thing.It will also open the doors (pardon the pun) to more investment, plus more virtual asset and proptech companies to move here. This project is a genuine 'gamechanger' and highlights just how forward thinking Dubai is when it comes to digital assets and becoming a leading global hub. Plus, credit must also go to the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority [VARA], DUBAI FUTURE FOUNDATION and Sandbox Real Estate for their contributions. hashtag#blockchain hashtag#dubai hashtag#dld hashtag#fractionalownership hashtag#tokenization hashtag#property hashtag#proptech hashtag#tokenisation

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

If you already own property, you may be contemplating whether to sell or continue investing in your current community. The Dubai market moves swiftly, and I always stress to my clients the importance of timing—wait too long, and you could miss out on key opportunities. While holding onto your property can be a great way to benefit from capital appreciation, market conditions in your particular community may sometimes make it more advantageous to sell and reinvest in a different property or community for better returns.

Justin HarperJustin Harper,,"Maybe you can afford that swanky villa on The Palm after all - or rather a portion of it. Thanks to a new tokenisation project.Dubai Land Department (DLD) has just launched the pilot phase of its 'Real Estate Tokenisation Project' to make it easier to buy and invest in real estate in the Emirate.This is how it works - real estate assets (properties) are converted into digital tokens using blockchain technology. Each property is divided into shares based on an investor’s budget, enabling what is called fractional ownership. Dubai's property market is already booming, with record sales and rising prices. This should give it another boost, allowing you to own a share of a property not the whole thing.It will also open the doors (pardon the pun) to more investment, plus more virtual asset and proptech companies to move here. This project is a genuine 'gamechanger' and highlights just how forward thinking Dubai is when it comes to digital assets and becoming a leading global hub. Plus, credit must also go to the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority [VARA], DUBAI FUTURE FOUNDATION and Sandbox Real Estate for their contributions. hashtag#blockchain hashtag#dubai hashtag#dld hashtag#fractionalownership hashtag#tokenization hashtag#property hashtag#proptech hashtag#tokenisation

NASSER SAJWANINASSER SAJWANI,,"Investing in beach access and waterfront lands, especially in Dubai Islands, offers several compelling advantages for both investors and developers. Let’s break it down:1. High Demand and Premium Pricing •	Properties with direct beach access or waterfront views are always in high demand — whether for luxury residences, hotels, or commercial spaces. •	These properties command premium prices, both in sales and rentals, ensuring higher ROI compared to inland developments.2. Unique Lifestyle Appeal •	Dubai is synonymous with luxury living. Waterfront properties offer an aspirational lifestyle — stunning views, private beaches, and resort-style living — which attracts high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and international buyers.3. Tourism and Hospitality Potential •	Dubai remains a global tourism hub, and beach destinations are among the most sought-after. •	Hotels, resorts, beach clubs, and vacation rentals on Dubai Islands can capture year-round tourist traffic, driven by Dubai’s appeal and its commitment to mega-events like EXPO 2020 legacy and Dubai Tourism Vision 2031.4. Limited Supply = Long-Term Value Appreciation •	Beachfront land is inherently limited, especially in prime areas like Dubai Islands. •	This scarcity drives long-term capital appreciation, making these investments more resilient during market fluctuations.5. Master Plan and Infrastructure Growth •	Dubai Islands (formerly Deira Islands) is now being revitalized with a strategic master plan — including marinas, luxury hotels, residences, and entertainment hubs. •	Infrastructure improvements, like better road connectivity, bridges, and public transport links, boost accessibility and land value.6. Government Support and Investor-Friendly Regulations •	Dubai Land Department (DLD) and RERA offer favorable laws for foreign investors, like 100% ownership in designated freehold areas. •	Golden Visas and residency perks for property investors further attract international capital.7. Diversified Development Opportunities •	Waterfront lands allow a diverse range of projects: high-end villas, branded residences, luxury apartments, resorts, beach clubs, and even commercial retail hubs designed for seaside leisure. •	Mixed-use developments with boardwalks, marinas, and dining promenades create sustainable, vibrant communities.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Eric-Jan van MeningenEric-Jan van Meningen,,"Abu Dhabi's ADQ partners with ECP for $25 billion-plus data centre energy projects.Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ has partnered with U.S. private equity firm Energy Capital Partners to invest more than $25 billion in energy projects to power data centres, mostly in the United States.The investments will be carried out through a 50-50 partnership across 25 gigawatts worth of new-build power generation and energy infrastructure, ADQ said in a statement on Wednesday.The partnership ""aims to service the growing power needs of data centers, hyperscale cloud companies and other energy-intensive industries,"" ADQ said.The deal coincides with a visit to the U.S. by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's national security adviser and brother of the country's president, who is also ADQ's chairman.During the visit, he met with President Donald Trump and discussed strengthening ties with the U.S. in sectors such as artificial intelligence and infrastructure, state news agency WAM reported on Wednesday.The small Gulf country - a wealthy oil producer and longtime security partner of the U.S.- has been working to obtain greater access to American technology and build its own advanced tech industry as part of its efforts to become a global AI hub and diversify its economy away from oil.Why This Partnership Matters:1. Addressing the AI Energy Surge – AI and high-density data centers are projected to increase global power demand by 50% by 2027 and 165% by 2030. This investment ensures a stable power supply to meet this exponential growth.2. Strengthening Energy Security – Data centers require constant, uninterrupted power. This initiative will focus on captive power plants, ensuring localized, reliable energy for mission-critical infrastructure.3. A Strategic US Market Entry – The US electricity demand is expected to add the equivalent of California’s current power consumption to the national grid in the next three years. The partnership will scale up power generation capacity, supporting the growing digital economy.4. A Long-Term, Sustainable Investment – With an initial $5 billion capital commitment, this initiative aims to develop 25 GW of energy projects, focusing on greenfield development, new build capacity, and strategic expansions.Insights from Industry LeadersMohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ:“AI’s rapid growth creates vast opportunities to power data centers and hyperscalers. Our partnership with ECP drives investment in next-generation energy solutions, ensuring a resilient and future-ready economy.”Doug Kimmelman, Founder & Chairman of ECP:“AI will drive economic growth, but only with sufficient power supply. Our partnership focuses on expanding natural gas-fired generation to meet the rising energy demands of hyperscalers.”Established in 2018, ADQ had $225 billion in assets under management across a broad portfolio of domestic assets, including energy and critical minerals & transport and logistics.

Fatima AlloghaniFatima Alloghani,,"Emiratisation is often misunderstood as a mere compliance requirement—a quota to be filled, a metric to be achieved. But what if we shifted our perspective?Companies that successfully localize their workforce don’t just meet quotas; they build sustainable, thriving businesses rooted in cultural understanding and long-term talent development.The Three Pillars of Sustainable Emiratisation🔹 Attracting the Right Emirati Talent Employer branding and Employee Value Proposition (EVP) are crucial. To attract top Emirati professionals, businesses must go beyond job postings and cultivate authentic, compelling employer brands that resonate with local talent.🔹 Retention & Engagement Hiring Emirati talent is just the beginning—the real challenge is keeping them engaged. Many leave due to limited career growth, lack of mentorship, or cultural misalignment. A strong retention strategy is built on trust, transparency, and long-term investment. Interestingly, company reputation ranks as the #1 priority for Emiratis when considering private sector jobs. Loyalty is earned through genuine commitment from day one.🔹 Business Growth Through Localization A well-integrated Emiratisation strategy drives tangible business success. Studies show that diverse, locally embedded teams enhance productivity, improve customer engagement, and strengthen overall business performance. Notably, training and development rank as the #2-highest priority for Emiratis when choosing private sector roles.

With rising demand pushing rentals higher in the region, affordable housing is no longer just a social priority—it’s an economic necessity. Governments and regulators are recognizing this. Dubai too recently announced initiatives in this space, signaling a broader trend in the UAE.Globally, we’ve seen that affordable housing doesn’t succeed without public-private collaboration. The best models integrate municipal incentives, private sector participation, and long-term urban planning. From a first glance, Abu Dhabi’s Value Housing Programme reflects this understanding.If executed well, this initiative can strengthen the city’s talent pipeline, enhance livability, and support business growth. Keen to see how this takes shape.(Views are personal)

Vimbainashe (Vimbai) R.Vimbainashe (Vimbai) R.,,"Exciting developments are underway in various Dubai communities, with many projects set to be completed between late 2025 and 2026. If you already own property, you may be contemplating whether to sell or continue investing in your current community. The Dubai market moves swiftly, and I always stress to my clients the importance of timing—wait too long, and you could miss out on key opportunities. While holding onto your property can be a great way to benefit from capital appreciation, market conditions in your particular community may sometimes make it more advantageous to sell and reinvest in a different property or community for better returns. Don't navigate this decision alone—let me analyze the market for you; ensure I truly understand your concerns and interpret the data in a way that’s meaningful to you, not just send you a generic report.Fun fact: I’m passionate about working with data, so this is always an exciting challenge for me.

Justin HarperJustin Harper,,"Maybe you can afford that swanky villa on The Palm after all - or rather a portion of it. Thanks to a new tokenisation project.Dubai Land Department (DLD) has just launched the pilot phase of its 'Real Estate Tokenisation Project' to make it easier to buy and invest in real estate in the Emirate.This is how it works - real estate assets (properties) are converted into digital tokens using blockchain technology. Each property is divided into shares based on an investor’s budget, enabling what is called fractional ownership. Dubai's property market is already booming, with record sales and rising prices. This should give it another boost, allowing you to own a share of a property not the whole thing.It will also open the doors (pardon the pun) to more investment, plus more virtual asset and proptech companies to move here. This project is a genuine 'gamechanger' and highlights just how forward thinking Dubai is when it comes to digital assets and becoming a leading global hub. Plus, credit must also go to the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority [VARA], DUBAI FUTURE FOUNDATION and Sandbox Real Estate for their contributions. hashtag#blockchain hashtag#dubai hashtag#dld hashtag#fractionalownership hashtag#tokenization hashtag#property hashtag#proptech hashtag#tokenisation

However, they must obtain special approval from the Department of Economy and Tourism.Financial companies based in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) are NOT affected by this rule. So, nothing changes for them.Businesses that want to expand beyond free zones must comply with all local laws and maintain separate accounting records for their free zone and mainland operations.Within the next six months, authorities will publish a list of permitted business activities that free zone companies can conduct on the mainland.Companies already operating outside free zones without the necessary approvals must comply with the new rules within a year. In some cases, this deadline may be extended.This regulation is part of Dubai’s ambitious plan to double its economy over the next ten years. The emirate aims to become one of the world’s top three economic hubs, and this new rule is another step toward that goal._______________hashtag#Dubai hashtag#UAE hashtag#BusinessInDubai hashtag#FreeZone hashtag#MainlandBusiness hashtag#DubaiEconomy hashtag#DubaiRegulations hashtag#DET hashtag#DubaiFreeZone hashtag#D33
