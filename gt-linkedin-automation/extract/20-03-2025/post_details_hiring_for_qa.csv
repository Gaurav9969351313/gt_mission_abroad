She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA

"Rizwan, MianRizwan, Mian",,"Slow job market and ‚Äòfake news‚Äô resumes are on the rise again.We interviewed few candidates lately for automation and manual QA positions. Each resume came with almost a decade of experience working for big brand applications from across the globe.One automation candidate who had built automation frameworks from scratch using Cypress and JavaScript and created page object model. I asked her to write a simple method that gets an element and then clicks on it. She replied she did not know what a method was but she could write a function instead.In page object model, all pages files are made of methods.I asked two candidates to find an even number from an array. I asked to find odd number from the third candidate. The candidate asked, shouldn‚Äôt I find the even number? ‚Ä¶ you know where I am going with this.One manual QA candidate who had worked for multiple multinationals could not tell what is in a test plan. And then to answer my question about what does a test case include? She started looking left and right. I am not sure how basic can a question be if someone cannot answer that.It is understandable that market is cold right now and people need jobs. But it takes a lot of effort in getting the budget approved for a new position, going through the resumes, preparing questions, doing the interviews and then submitting the feedback. Candidates who try to outsmart the hiring managers by adding fake experience and knowledge may get a temporary opportunity but how can they survive? It is like wasting their own time as well as the time of the hiring teams.Such candidates not only ruin it for themselves and fall in depression after getting rejected again and again but also block paths for those who really and truly qualify.This in my experience is a wave like trend that markets go super hot then super cold. Like cycles. They never stay the same forever.If you are looking for an opportunity but do not have what it takes for a job posting that you are applying for, instead of adding things that you don‚Äôt know. Upskill yourself, start from a position that matches your skill set. Keep on adding knowledge and experience and then sky is the limit.Remember all leaders you see today started from scratch. You can also be one but only by being honest, willing to learn, upskilling yourself and working hard towards it.hashtag#jobs hashtag#QA
