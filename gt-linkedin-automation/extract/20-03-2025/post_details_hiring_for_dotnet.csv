She provided me with prompt updates and ensured I was prepared every step of the way to succeed.As for the other addition, the bottom line is I got a new inexperienced boss and he‚Äôs demanding. Cares nothing about my qualifications, routinely leverages the ‚Äúother duties as assigned‚Äù clause and mandates night and weekend work.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement‚Äînot just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ‚ö†Ô∏è Restricted Opportunities ‚Äì Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ‚ö†Ô∏è No Guaranteed Job ‚Äì Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ‚ö†Ô∏è Exploitative Tactics ‚Äì This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.üîπ What You Can Do: ‚úÖ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ‚úÖ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ‚úÖ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ‚úÖ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let‚Äôs not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

You‚Äôre now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! ü´£ I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, ‚ÄúExcuse me, what?‚Äù Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You‚Äôre processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? üò¨Adjusting wasn‚Äôt easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. üèÜIf you ask me how did you survive?‚Ä¶.ummh I could say üå±‚úî hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let‚Äôs be real, without God‚Äôs grace, you‚Äôd have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.‚Äù (Philippians 4:13) üõê‚úî hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. üí™üèª‚úî hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).ü¶•‚úî hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh‚Ä¶ and pray.üòÖ‚ú®So here we are‚Äîstronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it! Who would‚Äôve thought? If anything, this year has proven that careers don‚Äôt always go as planned, but every experience adds value.

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

You‚Äôre now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! ü´£ I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, ‚ÄúExcuse me, what?‚Äù Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You‚Äôre processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? üò¨Adjusting wasn‚Äôt easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. üèÜIf you ask me how did you survive?‚Ä¶.ummh I could say üå±‚úî hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let‚Äôs be real, without God‚Äôs grace, you‚Äôd have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.‚Äù (Philippians 4:13) üõê‚úî hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. üí™üèª‚úî hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).ü¶•‚úî hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh‚Ä¶ and pray.üòÖ‚ú®So here we are‚Äîstronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it! Who would‚Äôve thought? If anything, this year has proven that careers don‚Äôt always go as planned, but every experience adds value.

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

You‚Äôre now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! ü´£ I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, ‚ÄúExcuse me, what?‚Äù Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You‚Äôre processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? üò¨Adjusting wasn‚Äôt easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. üèÜIf you ask me how did you survive?‚Ä¶.ummh I could say üå±‚úî hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let‚Äôs be real, without God‚Äôs grace, you‚Äôd have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.‚Äù (Philippians 4:13) üõê‚úî hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. üí™üèª‚úî hashtag#NewSkills, Who This?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about. When you‚Äôre excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you‚Äôll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you‚Äôve navigated a mid-career transition‚Äîor if you‚Äôre thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

You‚Äôre now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! ü´£ I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, ‚ÄúExcuse me, what?‚Äù Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You‚Äôre processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? üò¨Adjusting wasn‚Äôt easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. üèÜIf you ask me how did you survive?‚Ä¶.ummh I could say üå±‚úî hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let‚Äôs be real, without God‚Äôs grace, you‚Äôd have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.‚Äù (Philippians 4:13) üõê‚úî hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. üí™üèª‚úî hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).ü¶•‚úî hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh‚Ä¶ and pray.üòÖ‚ú®So here we are‚Äîstronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it! Who would‚Äôve thought? If anything, this year has proven that careers don‚Äôt always go as planned, but every experience adds value.

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you‚Äôre in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you‚Äôre not alone. But here‚Äôs the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don‚Äôt favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face‚Äîand how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:üîπ Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket‚Äîit‚Äôs a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. üîπ Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers‚Äîespecially younger ones‚Äîcare more about how you solve today‚Äôs problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôve done‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is how I can help you right now.‚Äùüîπ Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don‚Äôt have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you‚Äôre passionate about.

Blessytha Anu VargheseBlessytha Anu Varghese,,"I know this might be a common experience for many, but I still can‚Äôt help but celebrate, vent out and share a bit about this journey so far.So, here‚Äôs a letter to ‚ÄúLAST YEAR‚ÄôS ME!‚Äù üéâ‚úâÔ∏èDear hashtag#2024Me,ü§© Surprise! You‚Äôre now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! ü´£ I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, ‚ÄúExcuse me, what?‚Äù Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You‚Äôre processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? üò¨Adjusting wasn‚Äôt easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. üèÜIf you ask me how did you survive?‚Ä¶.ummh I could say üå±‚úî hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let‚Äôs be real, without God‚Äôs grace, you‚Äôd have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.‚Äù (Philippians 4:13) üõê‚úî hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. üí™üèª‚úî hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).ü¶•‚úî hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh‚Ä¶ and pray.üòÖ‚ú®So here we are‚Äîstronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it! Who would‚Äôve thought? If anything, this year has proven that careers don‚Äôt always go as planned, but every experience adds value. So Buckle Up~to Pivot like a Pro!hashtag#Remember‚ÄîGod‚Äôs plans are bigger than our Excel sheets. üïäÔ∏èWith gratitude and love,hashtag#2025You ü´Ç (a little wiser, a little upgraded and still figuring things out)P.S. Next time, if another unexpected career surprise takes place, maybe just trust the process? üòòA huge thanks to Genpact for continuing in turning surprises into hashtag#growth_opportunities and challenges into hashtag#learning_experiences‚ù£Ô∏è
