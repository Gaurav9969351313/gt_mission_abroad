Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Here are our top three takeaways from Sydney Lawson 🏳️‍🌈's conversation with Lauren Law, ReOps Manager at Contentful:✅ Simplified participation: Contentful breaks down ""how to sign up"" into a 4-step process, making it easy for participants to see why they should join. Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Rally UXRRally UXR,,"In today’s episode of our Panel tear-up series, we’re diving into how Contentful approaches user research recruitment 👉 they’ve built an experience that’s both seamless and strategic. Here are our top three takeaways from Sydney Lawson 🏳️‍🌈's conversation with Lauren Law, ReOps Manager at Contentful:✅ Simplified participation: Contentful breaks down ""how to sign up"" into a 4-step process, making it easy for participants to see why they should join. Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Here are our top three takeaways from Sydney Lawson 🏳️‍🌈's conversation with Lauren Law, ReOps Manager at Contentful:✅ Simplified participation: Contentful breaks down ""how to sign up"" into a 4-step process, making it easy for participants to see why they should join. Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

She provided me with prompt updates and ensured I was prepared every step of the way to succeed.As for the other addition, the bottom line is I got a new inexperienced boss and he’s demanding.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation? Let’s discuss. 👇 hashtag#RecruitmentEthics hashtag#Contractors hashtag#UKJobs hashtag#UnethicalRecruitment hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#IndianContractors hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#FairHiring hashtag#TechContracting hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#ITJobs

Here are our top three takeaways from Sydney Lawson 🏳️‍🌈's conversation with Lauren Law, ReOps Manager at Contentful:✅ Simplified participation: Contentful breaks down ""how to sign up"" into a 4-step process, making it easy for participants to see why they should join. Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

She provided me with prompt updates and ensured I was prepared every step of the way to succeed.As for the other addition, the bottom line is I got a new inexperienced boss and he’s demanding.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Ali RazaAli Raza,,"C# Pro Tip: Smarter Data Models 🚀Handling API data efficiently is key to writing clean, maintainable code. Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple. Efficient. Scalable. That’s how modern C# development should be.💬 How do you handle such cases in your projects?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Ali RazaAli Raza,,"C# Pro Tip: Smarter Data Models 🚀Handling API data efficiently is key to writing clean, maintainable code. Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

She provided me with prompt updates and ensured I was prepared every step of the way to succeed.As for the other addition, the bottom line is I got a new inexperienced boss and he’s demanding.

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Ali RazaAli Raza,,"C# Pro Tip: Smarter Data Models 🚀Handling API data efficiently is key to writing clean, maintainable code. Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple. Efficient. Scalable. That’s how modern C# development should be.💬 How do you handle such cases in your projects?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

Organizations are often successful due to the people that run them. Wendy Sterling from BINDT was excellent to work with. She provided me with prompt updates and ensured I was prepared every step of the way to succeed.As for the other addition, the bottom line is I got a new inexperienced boss and he’s demanding. Cares nothing about my qualifications, routinely leverages the “other duties as assigned” clause and mandates night and weekend work.

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Ali RazaAli Raza,,"C# Pro Tip: Smarter Data Models 🚀Handling API data efficiently is key to writing clean, maintainable code. Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple. Efficient. Scalable. That’s how modern C# development should be.💬 How do you handle such cases in your projects?

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

Organizations are often successful due to the people that run them. Wendy Sterling from BINDT was excellent to work with. She provided me with prompt updates and ensured I was prepared every step of the way to succeed.As for the other addition, the bottom line is I got a new inexperienced boss and he’s demanding. Cares nothing about my qualifications, routinely leverages the “other duties as assigned” clause and mandates night and weekend work.

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Ali RazaAli Raza,,"C# Pro Tip: Smarter Data Models 🚀Handling API data efficiently is key to writing clean, maintainable code. Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple. Efficient. Scalable. That’s how modern C# development should be.💬 How do you handle such cases in your projects?

You’re now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! 🫣 I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, “Excuse me, what?” Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You’re processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? 😬Adjusting wasn’t easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. 🏆If you ask me how did you survive?….ummh I could say 🌱✔ hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let’s be real, without God’s grace, you’d have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” (Philippians 4:13) 🛐✔ hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. 💪🏻✔ hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).🦥✔ hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh… and pray.😅✨So here we are—stronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it! Who would’ve thought? If anything, this year has proven that careers don’t always go as planned, but every experience adds value. So Buckle Up~to Pivot like a Pro!hashtag#Remember—God’s plans are bigger than our Excel sheets. 🕊️With gratitude and love,hashtag#2025You 🫂 (a little wiser, a little upgraded and still figuring things out)P.S. Next time, if another unexpected career surprise takes place, maybe just trust the process? 😘A huge thanks to Genpact for continuing in turning surprises into hashtag#growth_opportunities and challenges into hashtag#learning_experiences❣️

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

She provided me with prompt updates and ensured I was prepared every step of the way to succeed.As for the other addition, the bottom line is I got a new inexperienced boss and he’s demanding.

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Ali RazaAli Raza,,"C# Pro Tip: Smarter Data Models 🚀Handling API data efficiently is key to writing clean, maintainable code. Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple. Efficient. Scalable. That’s how modern C# development should be.💬 How do you handle such cases in your projects?

You’re now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! 🫣 I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, “Excuse me, what?” Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You’re processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? 😬Adjusting wasn’t easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. 🏆If you ask me how did you survive?….ummh I could say 🌱✔ hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let’s be real, without God’s grace, you’d have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” (Philippians 4:13) 🛐✔ hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. 💪🏻✔ hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).🦥✔ hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh… and pray.😅✨So here we are—stronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it! Who would’ve thought? If anything, this year has proven that careers don’t always go as planned, but every experience adds value. So Buckle Up~to Pivot like a Pro!hashtag#Remember—God’s plans are bigger than our Excel sheets. 🕊️With gratitude and love,hashtag#2025You 🫂 (a little wiser, a little upgraded and still figuring things out)P.S. Next time, if another unexpected career surprise takes place, maybe just trust the process? 😘A huge thanks to Genpact for continuing in turning surprises into hashtag#growth_opportunities and challenges into hashtag#learning_experiences❣️

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple.

Blessytha Anu VargheseBlessytha Anu Varghese,,"I know this might be a common experience for many, but I still can’t help but celebrate, vent out and share a bit about this journey so far.So, here’s a letter to “LAST YEAR’S ME!” 🎉✉️Dear hashtag#2024Me,🤩 Surprise! You’re now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! 🫣 I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, “Excuse me, what?” Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You’re processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? 😬Adjusting wasn’t easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. 🏆If you ask me how did you survive?….ummh I could say 🌱✔ hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let’s be real, without God’s grace, you’d have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” (Philippians 4:13) 🛐✔ hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. 💪🏻✔ hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).🦥✔ hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh… and pray.😅✨So here we are—stronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it!

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Ali RazaAli Raza,,"C# Pro Tip: Smarter Data Models 🚀Handling API data efficiently is key to writing clean, maintainable code. Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple. Efficient. Scalable. That’s how modern C# development should be.💬 How do you handle such cases in your projects?

Blessytha Anu VargheseBlessytha Anu Varghese,,"I know this might be a common experience for many, but I still can’t help but celebrate, vent out and share a bit about this journey so far.So, here’s a letter to “LAST YEAR’S ME!” 🎉✉️Dear hashtag#2024Me,🤩 Surprise! You’re now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! 🫣 I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, “Excuse me, what?” Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You’re processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? 😬Adjusting wasn’t easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. 🏆If you ask me how did you survive?….ummh I could say 🌱✔ hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let’s be real, without God’s grace, you’d have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” (Philippians 4:13) 🛐✔ hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. 💪🏻✔ hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).🦥✔ hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh… and pray.😅✨So here we are—stronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it! Who would’ve thought? If anything, this year has proven that careers don’t always go as planned, but every experience adds value. So Buckle Up~to Pivot like a Pro!hashtag#Remember—God’s plans are bigger than our Excel sheets. 🕊️With gratitude and love,hashtag#2025You 🫂 (a little wiser, a little upgraded and still figuring things out)P.S. Next time, if another unexpected career surprise takes place, maybe just trust the process? 😘A huge thanks to Genpact for continuing in turning surprises into hashtag#growth_opportunities and challenges into hashtag#learning_experiences❣️

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Consent is upfront and clear.🎨 Engaging & branded experience: A visually compelling sign-up page complete with custom graphics, logos, colors, and a progress bar keeps participants engaged and makes the experience feel polished. 🧠 Smarter matching for later recruitment: Contentful uses branched questions and skip logic to personalize the sign-up experience. Plus, they ask if participants are open to AI-related studies, making future recruitment even easier. Curious to see more?

Organizations are often successful due to the people that run them. Wendy Sterling from BINDT was excellent to work with. She provided me with prompt updates and ensured I was prepared every step of the way to succeed.As for the other addition, the bottom line is I got a new inexperienced boss and he’s demanding. Cares nothing about my qualifications, routinely leverages the “other duties as assigned” clause and mandates night and weekend work.

David RiceDavid Rice,,"If you’re in your 40s or 50s and thinking about a career change, you’re not alone. But here’s the challenge: the hiring world is still clinging to outdated models that don’t favor experienced professionals.In my latest conversation on the People Managing People podcast, I spoke with John Tarnoff MA/MSP, an expert in mid-career transitions, about the biggest hurdles midlife professionals face—and how to overcome them. Here are three takeaways I think have a lot of value:🔹 Ditch the Resume-First MentalityJohn argues that the hashtag#resume is no longer your golden ticket—it’s a placeholder at best. Instead, focus on your LinkedIn profile, your network, and your personal brand to showcase your real value. I'll go even further and say that based on other conversations I've had, it's time to start thinking about how you can package and showcase your skills and outcomes achieved rather than assembling a list of tasks completed and titles held. 🔹 Lead with Value, Not ExperienceMany mid-career professionals think their years of experience should speak for themselves. But hiring managers—especially younger ones—care more about how you solve today’s problems than war stories from the past. Shift your mindset from “this is what I’ve done” to “this is how I can help you right now.”🔹 Network with PurposeNot a natural networker? You don’t have to attend every event or send cold DMs. Instead, engage in meaningful conversations about topics you’re passionate about. When you’re excited about your work, networking feels less like a chore and more like building genuine relationships.The hiring system is broken. hashtag#Ageism is real. AI is changing the game. But if you approach your career pivot strategically, you’ll find new opportunities in places you never expected.Tell me in the comments if you’ve navigated a mid-career transition—or if you’re thinking about one. And check out my full conversation with John (link in the comments)!hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#CareerTransition

Ali RazaAli Raza,,"C# Pro Tip: Smarter Data Models 🚀Handling API data efficiently is key to writing clean, maintainable code. Instead of scattering logic across your codebase, let your model do the work.Why This Approach?✅ Cleaner Code – No redundant conditionals✅ Better Maintainability – Update logic in one place✅ No API Changes – The computed property isn’t serializedIf we need to show a ""Discount Applied"" tag in the UI, you can directly bind it to IsDiscountApplied—no extra logic required in the view! 🎯Simple. Efficient. Scalable. That’s how modern C# development should be.💬 How do you handle such cases in your projects?

Blessytha Anu VargheseBlessytha Anu Varghese,,"I know this might be a common experience for many, but I still can’t help but celebrate, vent out and share a bit about this journey so far.So, here’s a letter to “LAST YEAR’S ME!” 🎉✉️Dear hashtag#2024Me,🤩 Surprise! You’re now an hashtag#OrderManagementAssociate. No, not a banker. Not an insurance specialist. Not a financial analyst. Nor did you find yourself in the HR sector that sparked your excitement. But An ORDER. MANAGEMENT. ASSOCIATE. Let that sink in! 🫣 I can already see you raising an eyebrow and whispering, “Excuse me, what?” Trust me, I had the same reaction. After all, you spent years studying Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance hashtag#BFSI. And now? You’re processing purchase orders, dealing with logistics, and decoding the mysteries of supply chains. Plot twist, right? 😬Adjusting wasn’t easy. There were moments when you wanted to send a purchase order for a career shift ASAP. The jargon was new, the processes were different, and Excel spreadsheets became your new best frenemies. But hey, growth happens in the uncomfortable zones, not the cozy ones! And slowly, you adapted. 🏆If you ask me how did you survive?….ummh I could say 🌱✔ hashtag#Faith & hashtag#Strength: Because let’s be real, without God’s grace, you’d have hit Ctrl+Alt+Exit long ago. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” (Philippians 4:13) 🛐✔ hashtag#QuickLearningMode: Banking may have been your playground, but adaptability is your superpower. 💪🏻✔ hashtag#NewSkills, Who This? Customer service, process optimization, and even patience (because waiting on approvals should be classified as an Olympic sport).🦥✔ hashtag#SenseOfHumor: Because when systems crash right before submission deadlines, sometimes the only thing left to do is laugh… and pray.😅✨So here we are—stronger, smarter, and with a performance bonus to show for it! Who would’ve thought? If anything, this year has proven that careers don’t always go as planned, but every experience adds value. So Buckle Up~to Pivot like a Pro!hashtag#Remember—God’s plans are bigger than our Excel sheets. 🕊️With gratitude and love,hashtag#2025You 🫂 (a little wiser, a little upgraded and still figuring things out)P.S. Next time, if another unexpected career surprise takes place, maybe just trust the process? 😘A huge thanks to Genpact for continuing in turning surprises into hashtag#growth_opportunities and challenges into hashtag#learning_experiences❣️
