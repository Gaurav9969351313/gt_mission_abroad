Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Link385Link385,,"Some Facts About Remote Engineering Work:1. Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work. By embracing the flexibility of remote work and using the latest tools, we’ve been able to deliver high-quality designs and solutions while staying connected and efficient 🙂

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Link385Link385,,"Some Facts About Remote Engineering Work:1. Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work. By embracing the flexibility of remote work and using the latest tools, we’ve been able to deliver high-quality designs and solutions while staying connected and efficient 🙂

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work. By embracing the flexibility of remote work and using the latest tools, we’ve been able to deliver high-quality designs and solutions while staying connected and efficient 🙂

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Akash PayalAkash Payal,,"I still remember writing my first Java program back in school on JDK 1.3—just a simple public static void main with a bunch of System.out.println lines. And now? Java is diving into AI, post-quantum cryptography, and insane performance optimizations.Some features that made me go ""Wow!"":1. Vector API (9th Incubator) – Java is getting even better at handling AI & ML computations.2. Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (ML-KEM & ML-DSA) – Because, we know, the future.3. Stream Gatherers – More power, more flexibility for Java Streams.4. Shenandoah GC (Generational Mode) – Making garbage collection smarter and faster.5. Flexible Constructor Bodies – Because who doesn’t love cleaner, more structured code?Java has come so far, and honestly, it’s amazing to witness this evolution.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation? Let’s discuss. 👇 hashtag#RecruitmentEthics hashtag#Contractors hashtag#UKJobs hashtag#UnethicalRecruitment hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#IndianContractors hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#FairHiring hashtag#TechContracting hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#ITJobs

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work. By embracing the flexibility of remote work and using the latest tools, we’ve been able to deliver high-quality designs and solutions while staying connected and efficient 🙂

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation? Let’s discuss. 👇 hashtag#RecruitmentEthics hashtag#Contractors hashtag#UKJobs hashtag#UnethicalRecruitment hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#IndianContractors hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#FairHiring hashtag#TechContracting hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#ITJobs

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Link385Link385,,"Some Facts About Remote Engineering Work:1. Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work. By embracing the flexibility of remote work and using the latest tools, we’ve been able to deliver high-quality designs and solutions while staying connected and efficient 🙂

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Erika SzatmariErika Szatmari,,"Dynamic working isn’t just a trend—it’s a mindset shift.Gone are the days when productivity was measured by time spent at a desk. Today, it’s about flexibility, trust, and empowering people to do their best work wherever and however they thrive.Here’s why dynamic working works:✅ Increased productivity – When people have control over their environment, they perform better.✅ Better work-life balance – Flexibility helps people integrate work with life, not balance it on a tightrope.✅ Wider talent pool – You’re not limited by geography when remote and hybrid options are on the table.✅ Higher engagement and retention – Employees who feel trusted and empowered stick around longer.✅ Sustainability – Less commuting means a smaller carbon footprint.It’s not just about where we work—it’s about how we work together.How has dynamic working made a difference for you or your team?hashtag#DynamicWorking hashtag#Flexibility hashtag#wearecostain hashtag#WorkplaceCulture hashtag#costain160 hashtag#improvinglives

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation? Let’s discuss. 👇 hashtag#RecruitmentEthics hashtag#Contractors hashtag#UKJobs hashtag#UnethicalRecruitment hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#IndianContractors hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#FairHiring hashtag#TechContracting hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#ITJobs

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Link385Link385,,"Some Facts About Remote Engineering Work:1. Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work. By embracing the flexibility of remote work and using the latest tools, we’ve been able to deliver high-quality designs and solutions while staying connected and efficient 🙂

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Erika SzatmariErika Szatmari,,"Dynamic working isn’t just a trend—it’s a mindset shift.Gone are the days when productivity was measured by time spent at a desk. Today, it’s about flexibility, trust, and empowering people to do their best work wherever and however they thrive.Here’s why dynamic working works:✅ Increased productivity – When people have control over their environment, they perform better.✅ Better work-life balance – Flexibility helps people integrate work with life, not balance it on a tightrope.✅ Wider talent pool – You’re not limited by geography when remote and hybrid options are on the table.✅ Higher engagement and retention – Employees who feel trusted and empowered stick around longer.✅ Sustainability – Less commuting means a smaller carbon footprint.It’s not just about where we work—it’s about how we work together.How has dynamic working made a difference for you or your team?hashtag#DynamicWorking hashtag#Flexibility hashtag#wearecostain hashtag#WorkplaceCulture hashtag#costain160 hashtag#improvinglives

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance?

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Olga SachkovaOlga Sachkova,,"How Java Changed the Way I See the World ☕💡Before learning Java, I saw life as a series of random events. Now? Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Today, it’s about flexibility, trust, and empowering people to do their best work wherever and however they thrive.Here’s why dynamic working works:✅ Increased productivity – When people have control over their environment, they perform better.✅ Better work-life balance – Flexibility helps people integrate work with life, not balance it on a tightrope.✅ Wider talent pool – You’re not limited by geography when remote and hybrid options are on the table.✅ Higher engagement and retention – Employees who feel trusted and empowered stick around longer.✅ Sustainability – Less commuting means a smaller carbon footprint.It’s not just about where we work—it’s about how we work together.How has dynamic working made a difference for you or your team?hashtag#DynamicWorking hashtag#Flexibility hashtag#wearecostain hashtag#WorkplaceCulture hashtag#costain160 hashtag#improvinglives

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3!

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work. By embracing the flexibility of remote work and using the latest tools, we’ve been able to deliver high-quality designs and solutions while staying connected and efficient 🙂

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Today, it’s about flexibility, trust, and empowering people to do their best work wherever and however they thrive.Here’s why dynamic working works:✅ Increased productivity – When people have control over their environment, they perform better.✅ Better work-life balance – Flexibility helps people integrate work with life, not balance it on a tightrope.✅ Wider talent pool – You’re not limited by geography when remote and hybrid options are on the table.✅ Higher engagement and retention – Employees who feel trusted and empowered stick around longer.✅ Sustainability – Less commuting means a smaller carbon footprint.It’s not just about where we work—it’s about how we work together.How has dynamic working made a difference for you or your team?hashtag#DynamicWorking hashtag#Flexibility hashtag#wearecostain hashtag#WorkplaceCulture hashtag#costain160 hashtag#improvinglives

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting!

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy? Let’s discuss!hashtag#workplaceexperiece hashtag#pleo hashtag#workspace hashtag#offices hashtag#humanconnection hashtag#humaninteraction hashtag#growth

Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work.

Akash PayalAkash Payal,,"I still remember writing my first Java program back in school on JDK 1.3—just a simple public static void main with a bunch of System.out.println lines. And now? Java is diving into AI, post-quantum cryptography, and insane performance optimizations.Some features that made me go ""Wow!"":1. Vector API (9th Incubator) – Java is getting even better at handling AI & ML computations.2. Quantum-Resistant Cryptography (ML-KEM & ML-DSA) – Because, we know, the future.3. Stream Gatherers – More power, more flexibility for Java Streams.4. Shenandoah GC (Generational Mode) – Making garbage collection smarter and faster.5.

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone. Let’s not allow bad practices to take hold. Have you faced a similar situation?

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Leonardo F.Leonardo F.,,"🚀 Day 13 of hashtag#100DaysOfCode - Java Design Patterns with the Factory MethodToday, I took a dive into the Factory Method design pattern. The idea is simple but powerful, instead of creating objects directly using new, you delegate that responsibility to a specialized method.This helps decouple code, makes it more scalable, and follows best practices like the Open/Closed Principle. One common example is a logistics system, where different transport types (Truck, Ship, Plane) can be created dynamically without modifying existing code.Still exploring more use cases, but so far, I find it super interesting! This post from refactoring.guru about the topic is a really good break down: https://lnkd.in/dVBawTJEhashtag#Java hashtag#DesignPatterns hashtag#FactoryMethod hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

Luís Alves FerreiraLuís Alves Ferreira,,"The Economic Impact of Remote Work: A Perspective from PortugalThe way we work has changed dramatically in recent years, but one thing remains true—economic growth thrives on hashtag#human hashtag#interaction and the exchange of goods and services. hashtag#Portugal has been one of the European countries with the lowest rates of remote work, as shown in recent data. And perhaps not coincidentally, Portugal has also been a rising economic force in Europe, attracting investment, innovation, and talent.When people commute to work, they contribute to the local economy. They stop by the café for a morning espresso, grab lunch at a restaurant, buy clothes for the office, and engage in countless microtransactions that keep businesses alive. The vibrancy of a city is deeply connected to its workforce being present and engaged.As someone leading hashtag#workplace hashtag#strategy, I see firsthand the power of an inspiring, well-designed hashtag#office. A thoughtfully curated space fosters collaboration, serendipitous conversations, and a culture of belonging—things that are hard to replicate remotely. At Pleo we take pride in designing hashtag#workplaces that are not just functional but magnetic. Our Lisbon hub stands out as the office with the highest attendance across our locations, despite our team being predominantly international. This speaks volumes about the unique, sustainable, and forward-thinking hashtag#workplace hashtag#experience we’ve built.The future of work is not about forcing people back into offices but about making them want to be there. When we create environments that people love, they show up—and in doing so, they contribute not just to their company’s success, but to the economy and community around them.What are your thoughts on the role of physical workplaces in today’s economy?

Cleiton EstefenonCleiton Estefenon,,"Serial GC: The Forgotten Garbage Collector (But Still Useful)?The Serial Garbage Collector runs on a single thread, making it efficient by avoiding thread communication overhead. While often overlooked, it can still be useful for small applications and low-memory environments.When should you consider using it? - Applications with low memory usage (up to ~100MB). - Single-threaded environments or machines with limited resources. - Small servers where complex GC strategies aren't necessary.The downside? - It pauses application execution during garbage collection, which can  impact performance.Fun fact: - The Serial GC was the default until JDK 1.3! In JDK 1.4, Parallel GC became the default for multi-CPU systems, while Serial GC remained the default for single-CPU machines.Want to try it?

Link385Link385,,"Some Facts About Remote Engineering Work:1. Remote Engineering Was Rare Before 2020-Before the COVID-19 pandemic, most engineering firms required in-office work due to complex software, team collaboration, and hands-on testing.-Only 5-10% of engineers worked remotely before 2020.2. The Pandemic Made Remote Engineering Common-The 2020 pandemic forced major engineering firms to shift to remote work.-Companies invested in cloud-based CAD software, VPNs, and virtual collaboration tools to enable engineers to work from home.3. CAD and Simulation Software Went to the Cloud-Traditional CAD software required powerful office workstations.-Now, cloud-based CAD tools like AutoCAD allow engineers to design from anywhere.Link385 has been part of the remote mechanical design engineering community for some time now, and we’ve been really successful in making it work. By embracing the flexibility of remote work and using the latest tools, we’ve been able to deliver high-quality designs and solutions while staying connected and efficient 🙂

Alagarsamy RajamannarAlagarsamy Rajamannar,,"🚨 Beware of Unethical Recruitment Practices in the UK Contract Market 🚨I've come across a troubling practice among certain recruiters working for Indian companies in the UK. They target Indian-origin contractors for specific roles, ask for their CVs, and then push them to sign a sole representation agreement—not just for that role, but for similar roles as well.This raises serious ethical concerns: ⚠️ Restricted Opportunities – Signing such agreements can prevent you from applying for similar roles through other agencies. ⚠️ No Guaranteed Job – Many recruiters use these agreements to monopolize candidates without actually securing a role for them. ⚠️ Exploitative Tactics – This benefits recruiters more than contractors, limiting your job prospects.🔹 What You Can Do: ✅ Never sign a sole representation agreement unless there's a guaranteed contract. ✅ Ask recruiters why they need exclusivity and how it benefits you. ✅ Report unethical recruiters to job boards and professional networks. ✅ Share this with fellow contractors to raise awareness.A fair job market benefits everyone.

Everything is an object with properties and methods!I’m basically a Parent Class, passing down wisdom to my Child Classes (friends, colleagues, future me). Encapsulation taught me to set boundaries - some things should stay private! Polymorphism? That’s just a fancy way of saying “go with the flow.” And inheritance? Well, we all pick up traits from past experiences (some more useful than others 😆).Even in tough times, I remind myself: Handle exceptions and keep running.

Erika SzatmariErika Szatmari,,"Dynamic working isn’t just a trend—it’s a mindset shift.Gone are the days when productivity was measured by time spent at a desk. Today, it’s about flexibility, trust, and empowering people to do their best work wherever and however they thrive.Here’s why dynamic working works:✅ Increased productivity – When people have control over their environment, they perform better.✅ Better work-life balance – Flexibility helps people integrate work with life, not balance it on a tightrope.✅ Wider talent pool – You’re not limited by geography when remote and hybrid options are on the table.✅ Higher engagement and retention – Employees who feel trusted and empowered stick around longer.✅ Sustainability – Less commuting means a smaller carbon footprint.It’s not just about where we work—it’s about how we work together.How has dynamic working made a difference for you or your team?hashtag#DynamicWorking hashtag#Flexibility hashtag#wearecostain hashtag#WorkplaceCulture hashtag#costain160 hashtag#improvinglives
