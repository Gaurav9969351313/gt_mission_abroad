Both bring unique strengths to the table, and the right mix can create a well-rounded, high-performing audit team.✅ Chartered Accountants (CAs):Strong technical knowledge in accounting, taxation, and financial reportingExpertise in risk assessment and regulatory complianceStructured approach to audits, leveraging professional training✅ Non-CAs (MBAs, Engineers, etc.):Diverse perspectives on business processes and operational risksStrong analytical and problem-solving skillsAbility to integrate technology and data analytics into audit processesFor NBFCs, internal audit isn't just about compliance—it’s about adding value. While CAs provide the foundation of financial expertise, non-CAs bring a fresh perspective on risk and controls. The ideal team should be a blend of both, ensuring a holistic approach to governance, risk, and compliance.What’s your take?

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Two giants in this space, Teradata and Snowflake, offer distinct features and capabilities. Here’s a quick comparison of the key differences:🔹 Architecture:Teradata: Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) with tightly coupled compute and storage.Snowflake: Cloud-native with decoupled compute and storage, enabling flexible scaling.🔹 Performance Optimization:Teradata: Requires manual tuning for optimization.Snowflake: Automatic optimization with auto-scaling and query caching.🔹 Pricing:Teradata: Traditional license/subscription model, typically more complex and expensive.Snowflake: Flexible pay-as-you-go model for compute and storage, making it cost-efficient for dynamic workloads.🔹 Cloud Adoption:Teradata: Hybrid and on-premises deployments, also with cloud-based Teradata Vantage.Snowflake: Fully cloud-based, optimized for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.When deciding between Teradata and Snowflake, it’s essential to consider your business needs, scalability requirements, and existing infrastructure. 🌍👉 Are you team Teradata or Snowflake?

Prakash R.Prakash R.,,"hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Chartered hashtag#Accountants vs. hashtag#Non-CAs in Internal Audit for NBFCs: Striking the Right hashtag#BalanceIn the evolving landscape of internal audit for hashtag#NBFCs, one common debate is whether to hire Chartered Accountants (CAs) or non-CAs for audit roles. Both bring unique strengths to the table, and the right mix can create a well-rounded, high-performing audit team.✅ Chartered Accountants (CAs):Strong technical knowledge in accounting, taxation, and financial reportingExpertise in risk assessment and regulatory complianceStructured approach to audits, leveraging professional training✅ Non-CAs (MBAs, Engineers, etc.):Diverse perspectives on business processes and operational risksStrong analytical and problem-solving skillsAbility to integrate technology and data analytics into audit processesFor NBFCs, internal audit isn't just about compliance—it’s about adding value. While CAs provide the foundation of financial expertise, non-CAs bring a fresh perspective on risk and controls. The ideal team should be a blend of both, ensuring a holistic approach to governance, risk, and compliance.What’s your take?

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Two giants in this space, Teradata and Snowflake, offer distinct features and capabilities. Here’s a quick comparison of the key differences:🔹 Architecture:Teradata: Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) with tightly coupled compute and storage.Snowflake: Cloud-native with decoupled compute and storage, enabling flexible scaling.🔹 Performance Optimization:Teradata: Requires manual tuning for optimization.Snowflake: Automatic optimization with auto-scaling and query caching.🔹 Pricing:Teradata: Traditional license/subscription model, typically more complex and expensive.Snowflake: Flexible pay-as-you-go model for compute and storage, making it cost-efficient for dynamic workloads.🔹 Cloud Adoption:Teradata: Hybrid and on-premises deployments, also with cloud-based Teradata Vantage.Snowflake: Fully cloud-based, optimized for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.When deciding between Teradata and Snowflake, it’s essential to consider your business needs, scalability requirements, and existing infrastructure. 🌍👉 Are you team Teradata or Snowflake?
