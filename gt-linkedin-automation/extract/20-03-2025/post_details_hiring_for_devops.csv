Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

DevOps is about building a collaborative team where development, operations, and security work together seamlessly.The reason organizations struggle to find good DevOps talent is because they're often searching for a single person to fit a role that’s meant to be shared across multiple teams.What about you what is your understanding of DevOps?hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CloudEngineering hashtag#Automation hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#Leadership hashtag#ITInfrastructure hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#DevOpsCulture

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Sometimes, you outgrow yourself and your startup. Wearing multiple - or even all - the hats? Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

I also have experience in networking, security, and incident response, all skills directly applicable to Epic’s tech roles.Beyond my internship, I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Web Development at Full Sail University, where I’ve built real-world projects integrating JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, and AWS services.Yet, despite checking every box—having relevant technical skills, being a 100% disabled combat veteran, and even aligning my experience with the exact role Epic is hiring for—I haven’t been considered for a single interview.I don’t assume I know everything. I come from construction, security, and emergency management, and I’m used to working under pressure and adapting fast. I’ve proven I can learn—so why am I not even getting a conversation?If anyone has insight into Epic’s hiring process, especially for veteran candidates, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Brad M.Brad M.,,"I'll be at AWS as a Cloud Support Associate Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS) this summer. I will work hands-on with cloud infrastructure, automation, and troubleshooting in Linux and Windows environments. I also have experience in networking, security, and incident response, all skills directly applicable to Epic’s tech roles.Beyond my internship, I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Web Development at Full Sail University, where I’ve built real-world projects integrating JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, and AWS services.Yet, despite checking every box—having relevant technical skills, being a 100% disabled combat veteran, and even aligning my experience with the exact role Epic is hiring for—I haven’t been considered for a single interview.I don’t assume I know everything. I come from construction, security, and emergency management, and I’m used to working under pressure and adapting fast. I’ve proven I can learn—so why am I not even getting a conversation?If anyone has insight into Epic’s hiring process, especially for veteran candidates, I’d love to hear your thoughts. If there’s something I’m missing, I’m open to feedback. I’m here to learn, contribute, and grow—but I need the opportunity.hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#AWS hashtag#InfrastructureEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#SoftwareEngineeringhashtag#TechCareers hashtag#CloudEngineering hashtag#EpicSystems hashtag#EpicCareers hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#InterviewExperience hashtag#TechRecruiting hashtag#VeteransInTech hashtag#DiversityHiring hashtag#MilitaryToTech hashtag#VeteranJobs hashtag#CareerTransition hashtag#TechInternship hashtag#InternToFullTime hashtag#EntryLevelTech hashtag#JobHunt hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#HiringTransparency hashtag#EqualOpportunity hashtag#JobFairness hashtag#HRInsights

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

I also have experience in networking, security, and incident response, all skills directly applicable to Epic’s tech roles.Beyond my internship, I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Web Development at Full Sail University, where I’ve built real-world projects integrating JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, and AWS services.Yet, despite checking every box—having relevant technical skills, being a 100% disabled combat veteran, and even aligning my experience with the exact role Epic is hiring for—I haven’t been considered for a single interview.I don’t assume I know everything. I come from construction, security, and emergency management, and I’m used to working under pressure and adapting fast. I’ve proven I can learn—so why am I not even getting a conversation?If anyone has insight into Epic’s hiring process, especially for veteran candidates, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Sometimes, you outgrow yourself and your startup. Wearing multiple - or even all - the hats? Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

I also have experience in networking, security, and incident response, all skills directly applicable to Epic’s tech roles.Beyond my internship, I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Web Development at Full Sail University, where I’ve built real-world projects integrating JavaScript, React, Node.js, MySQL, and AWS services.Yet, despite checking every box—having relevant technical skills, being a 100% disabled combat veteran, and even aligning my experience with the exact role Epic is hiring for—I haven’t been considered for a single interview.I don’t assume I know everything. I come from construction, security, and emergency management, and I’m used to working under pressure and adapting fast. I’ve proven I can learn—so why am I not even getting a conversation?If anyone has insight into Epic’s hiring process, especially for veteran candidates, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Sometimes, you outgrow yourself and your startup. Wearing multiple - or even all - the hats? Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

Bastiaan VermeulenBastiaan Vermeulen,,"Okay, we’ve automated job ads, AI is screening CVs, and recruiters are whispering sweet nothings to ChatGPT. Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers. It’s about balancing humanity and technology - people who can think, lead, and adapt.Right now, most companies are getting it wrong.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Sometimes, you outgrow yourself and your startup. Wearing multiple - or even all - the hats? Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

Yet, hiring managers are still screaming for stronger human skills.Because here’s the thing: A technically brilliant workforce that lacks leadership, adaptability, and critical thinking is just an expensive IT helpdesk.- AI can write code. But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Sometimes, you outgrow yourself and your startup. Wearing multiple - or even all - the hats? Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Sometimes, you outgrow yourself and your startup. Wearing multiple - or even all - the hats? Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.

But can your engineers challenge a bad product decision?- Automation can streamline processes. But can your team pivot when the market shifts?- Data can give insights. But can your leaders turn them into action?Hiring for 2025 and beyond isn’t just about stacking the team with DevOps pros and AI whisperers.

Matt A.Matt A.,,"Sometimes, you outgrow yourself and your startup. Wearing multiple - or even all - the hats? Sales, marketing, project management, testing, product development… At some point, something’s gotta give.So, when is the right time to get help?Some warning signs:- You’re stretched too thin, spending more time working in the business rather than on it strategically.- You’re missing deadlines - or worse yet, sales calls.- You wake up feeling drained, demotivated or just exhausted.- You’re not getting enough time for yourself, your family or your friends.Bringing in the right support at the right time can make a HUGE difference between sustainable growth and burnout 🫣Some things I’ve seen from working with startups over the past 7 years:🫣 Founders pushing themselves to the limit - juggling capital raising, content creation, podcasts, running events, testing and trying to do. it. all. solo. 🫣 Product managers overloaded - stuck between product development, sales and engineering while also handling testing, product roadmap and more.🫣 CTOs wearing too many hats - coding EVERYTHING, setting the strategic direction, talking to customers … all while managing another full-time job.If you’ve ever thought you need more help but worry about breaking your budget, Tekkon might be the right fit.At Tekkon, we help startups scale faster by connecting them with skilled and cost-effective remote tech talent - aka Tekkies.Some of the roles we help hire:🧑‍💻 Full-Stack, Frontend & Backend Developers👩‍💻 Testers & QA Specialists👨‍💻 Project Managers👨‍💻 Mobile App Developers👩‍💻 AI/ML Engineers👩‍💻 Data Analysts, Scientists & Engineers🧑‍💻 DevOps👨‍💻 UI/UX Designers👩‍💻 Cybersecurity SpecialistsExamples of how we’ve helped startups in the past, include:💡 A full-time working CTO built out their entire development team (devs & testers) while using a dedicated project manager as a single point of contact.💡 A busy founder offloaded testing to an experienced tester - giving them back time to focus on growth while setting up better team structures.💡 Multiple startups filled skill gaps in UI/UX, DevOps, AI/ML, frontend development, data engineering and more.Beyond hiring, I’ve personally helped:- Non-tech founders find capable CTOs & tech leaders to help them better understand the tech side of their journey.- Founders connect across my networks in Japan & Australia - opening doors to new partnerships and opportunities.- Business owners find trusted professionals when they needed specific services.So if you need someone to listen, and potentially help you find the right support too, know that I’m here.Sometimes, stepping back is what helps you move forward.When you’re ready to breathe again, let’s talk.
