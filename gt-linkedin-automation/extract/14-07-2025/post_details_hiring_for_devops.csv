Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"A Kubernetes project typically involves containerizing an application and deploying it on a Kubernetes cluster for better scalability, resilience, and automation. For example, consider a microservices-based e-commerce platform. The project begins by creating Docker images for each microservice (like user, cart, product, and payment). These images are pushed to a container registry.Next, Kubernetes manifests such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Ingress are written. Deployments ensure desired replica states, Services enable internal communication, and Ingress manages external access. Helm charts or Kustomize can be used for configuration management.A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins) automates image builds, tests, and Kubernetes deployments. Monitoring is integrated using Prometheus and Grafana, while logging is handled via Fluentd and Elasticsearch.The final implementation results in a robust, self-healing, scalable system with rolling updates and zero downtime deployments, making the application production-ready and easier to maintain across environments.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudEngineer hashtag#ThankYou hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#TechCommunity

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"A Kubernetes project typically involves containerizing an application and deploying it on a Kubernetes cluster for better scalability, resilience, and automation. For example, consider a microservices-based e-commerce platform. The project begins by creating Docker images for each microservice (like user, cart, product, and payment). These images are pushed to a container registry.Next, Kubernetes manifests such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Ingress are written. Deployments ensure desired replica states, Services enable internal communication, and Ingress manages external access. Helm charts or Kustomize can be used for configuration management.A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions or Jenkins) automates image builds, tests, and Kubernetes deployments. Monitoring is integrated using Prometheus and Grafana, while logging is handled via Fluentd and Elasticsearch.The final implementation results in a robust, self-healing, scalable system with rolling updates and zero downtime deployments, making the application production-ready and easier to maintain across environments.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Docker hashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudEngineer hashtag#ThankYou hashtag#ProfessionalGrowth hashtag#TechCommunity
