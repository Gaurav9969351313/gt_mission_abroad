I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation. To my connections, I would really appreciate your help if you know someone or you are someone who is hiring for semiconductor roles, please reach out to me, and we can connect and have a chat about my relevant expertise.

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

Muhammad Redwan HassanMuhammad Redwan Hassan,,"Hi, all! I was impacted by Intel’s headcount reduction this week. I have spent 1 year at Intel Foundry as a Lithography module development engineer. In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation. To my connections, I would really appreciate your help if you know someone or you are someone who is hiring for semiconductor roles, please reach out to me, and we can connect and have a chat about my relevant expertise.

I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

Muhammad Redwan HassanMuhammad Redwan Hassan,,"Hi, all! I was impacted by Intel’s headcount reduction this week. I have spent 1 year at Intel Foundry as a Lithography module development engineer. In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation. To my connections, I would really appreciate your help if you know someone or you are someone who is hiring for semiconductor roles, please reach out to me, and we can connect and have a chat about my relevant expertise.

Muhammad Redwan HassanMuhammad Redwan Hassan,,"Hi, all! I was impacted by Intel’s headcount reduction this week. I have spent 1 year at Intel Foundry as a Lithography module development engineer. In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation. To my connections, I would really appreciate your help if you know someone or you are someone who is hiring for semiconductor roles, please reach out to me, and we can connect and have a chat about my relevant expertise.

I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

Muhammad Redwan HassanMuhammad Redwan Hassan,,"Hi, all! I was impacted by Intel’s headcount reduction this week. I have spent 1 year at Intel Foundry as a Lithography module development engineer. In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation. To my connections, I would really appreciate your help if you know someone or you are someone who is hiring for semiconductor roles, please reach out to me, and we can connect and have a chat about my relevant expertise.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code. DSA will teach you how to think.

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code. DSA will teach you how to think.

Muhammad Redwan HassanMuhammad Redwan Hassan,,"Hi, all! I was impacted by Intel’s headcount reduction this week. I have spent 1 year at Intel Foundry as a Lithography module development engineer. In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation. To my connections, I would really appreciate your help if you know someone or you are someone who is hiring for semiconductor roles, please reach out to me, and we can connect and have a chat about my relevant expertise.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

Muhammad Redwan HassanMuhammad Redwan Hassan,,"Hi, all! I was impacted by Intel’s headcount reduction this week. I have spent 1 year at Intel Foundry as a Lithography module development engineer. In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation. To my connections, I would really appreciate your help if you know someone or you are someone who is hiring for semiconductor roles, please reach out to me, and we can connect and have a chat about my relevant expertise.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

It’s you. 😬📣 A/B testing job posts – Turns out “rockstar ninja” doesn’t bring actual engineers.🧠 Analyzing Glassdoor reviews like product feedback – Because “toxic” is not just a bad smell, it’s a retention risk.🧭 Mapping talent personas – Hiring isn’t one-size-fits-all. Neither is branding.📊 Measuring which content gets actual clicks – That fancy employer video?

Saugata SinghSaugata Singh,,"🚨 Product Management Is NOT a Promotion From Being a Great Engineer, Designer, or Marketer! 🚨..💡 Being a PM isn’t a reward—it’s a completely different skill set...So if you're thinking of transitioning into PM, or hiring one, here’s what you need to know. 👇..💠 PMs Don’t Build—They Enable Others to Build.Bad Transition:❌ A great engineer turned PM who still wants to jump into the codebase instead of aligning priorities.❌ A great designer turned PM who obsesses over UI details instead of solving the right problems.Good Transition:✅ Understands the product at a high level but trusts the team to execute.✅ Focuses on customer needs, business outcomes, and team alignment—not doing the work themselves.🛠 Pro Tip: If you’re moving into PM, resist the urge to ""do the work"" and focus on enabling others instead..💠 Decisions Are Based on Data, Not Just Intuition.Bad Transition:❌ ""This feature feels cool—let’s build it!""❌ ""I would use this, so our users must need it too."".Good Transition:✅ ""User research and analytics show this problem is costing us $X per month. Here’s the case for solving it.""✅ ""We ran an A/B test—Option A increased conversion by 18%. Let’s scale it."".🛠 Pro Tip: Your opinion doesn’t matter—the only thing that matters is customer needs and business impact..💠 You’re Accountable Without Having Authority.Bad Transition:❌ ""Engineering should build this because I said so.""❌ ""Design should just trust me—I know what’s best for the user."".Good Transition:✅ ""I aligned with stakeholders before the meeting so everyone is on the same page.""✅ ""Here’s how this fits our company goals and why solving it benefits us all."".🛠 Pro Tip: If you can’t influence without authority, you won’t survive as a PM..💠 Time Management = Ruthless Prioritization.Bad Transition:❌ ""I’ll handle every request that comes in.""❌ ""Let’s add this to the backlog just in case."".Good Transition:✅ ""We’re focusing on what moves the needle, not what’s loudest.""✅ ""This aligns with our strategy—let’s prioritize it. That request? Not right now."".🛠 Pro Tip: If everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Learn to say no strategically..💠 Success Is About Outcomes, Not Outputs.Bad Transition:❌ ""We launched 10 features this quarter!""❌ ""The roadmap is 100% delivered—great job!"".Good Transition:✅ ""User engagement increased by 30% after we improved onboarding.""✅ ""Revenue grew 12% because of the pricing changes we introduced."".🛠 Pro Tip: No one cares how much you ship. They care what impact it had. Measure success in outcomes, not outputs.The best PMs don’t focus on being right—they focus on getting it right.So, are you ready? 🚀..hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#PMTransition hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Influence hashtag#ProductManager hashtag#ProductRole hashtag#ProductMind

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

It’s you. 😬📣 A/B testing job posts – Turns out “rockstar ninja” doesn’t bring actual engineers.🧠 Analyzing Glassdoor reviews like product feedback – Because “toxic” is not just a bad smell, it’s a retention risk.🧭 Mapping talent personas – Hiring isn’t one-size-fits-all. Neither is branding.📊 Measuring which content gets actual clicks – That fancy employer video?

Saugata SinghSaugata Singh,,"🚨 Product Management Is NOT a Promotion From Being a Great Engineer, Designer, or Marketer! 🚨..💡 Being a PM isn’t a reward—it’s a completely different skill set...So if you're thinking of transitioning into PM, or hiring one, here’s what you need to know. 👇..💠 PMs Don’t Build—They Enable Others to Build.Bad Transition:❌ A great engineer turned PM who still wants to jump into the codebase instead of aligning priorities.❌ A great designer turned PM who obsesses over UI details instead of solving the right problems.Good Transition:✅ Understands the product at a high level but trusts the team to execute.✅ Focuses on customer needs, business outcomes, and team alignment—not doing the work themselves.🛠 Pro Tip: If you’re moving into PM, resist the urge to ""do the work"" and focus on enabling others instead..💠 Decisions Are Based on Data, Not Just Intuition.Bad Transition:❌ ""This feature feels cool—let’s build it!""❌ ""I would use this, so our users must need it too."".Good Transition:✅ ""User research and analytics show this problem is costing us $X per month. Here’s the case for solving it.""✅ ""We ran an A/B test—Option A increased conversion by 18%. Let’s scale it."".🛠 Pro Tip: Your opinion doesn’t matter—the only thing that matters is customer needs and business impact..💠 You’re Accountable Without Having Authority.Bad Transition:❌ ""Engineering should build this because I said so.""❌ ""Design should just trust me—I know what’s best for the user."".Good Transition:✅ ""I aligned with stakeholders before the meeting so everyone is on the same page.""✅ ""Here’s how this fits our company goals and why solving it benefits us all."".🛠 Pro Tip: If you can’t influence without authority, you won’t survive as a PM..💠 Time Management = Ruthless Prioritization.Bad Transition:❌ ""I’ll handle every request that comes in.""❌ ""Let’s add this to the backlog just in case."".Good Transition:✅ ""We’re focusing on what moves the needle, not what’s loudest.""✅ ""This aligns with our strategy—let’s prioritize it. That request? Not right now."".🛠 Pro Tip: If everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Learn to say no strategically..💠 Success Is About Outcomes, Not Outputs.Bad Transition:❌ ""We launched 10 features this quarter!""❌ ""The roadmap is 100% delivered—great job!"".Good Transition:✅ ""User engagement increased by 30% after we improved onboarding.""✅ ""Revenue grew 12% because of the pricing changes we introduced."".🛠 Pro Tip: No one cares how much you ship. They care what impact it had. Measure success in outcomes, not outputs.The best PMs don’t focus on being right—they focus on getting it right.So, are you ready? 🚀..hashtag#ProductManagement hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#PMTransition hashtag#Leadership hashtag#Influence hashtag#ProductManager hashtag#ProductRole hashtag#ProductMind

In this tenure, I learned about complex semiconductor logic device manufacturing process, lithography principles and applications, metrology, and statistics. I also learned how to implement data analysis and image analysis skills to solve module-specific problems.I have a Phd in Chemistry with a strong background in optical instrument development, laser, experimental design, flow batteries, and soft material analysis. I was fortunate that Intel was the first stepping stone of my journey to industry from academia. Right now, I am looking for roles in the semiconductor industry and am open to relocation.

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

Here’s the case for solving it.""✅ ""We ran an A/B test—Option A increased conversion by 18%. Let’s scale it."".🛠 Pro Tip: Your opinion doesn’t matter—the only thing that matters is customer needs and business impact..💠 You’re Accountable Without Having Authority.Bad Transition:❌ ""Engineering should build this because I said so.""❌ ""Design should just trust me—I know what’s best for the user."".Good Transition:✅ ""I aligned with stakeholders before the meeting so everyone is on the same page.""✅ ""Here’s how this fits our company goals and why solving it benefits us all."".🛠 Pro Tip: If you can’t influence without authority, you won’t survive as a PM..💠 Time Management = Ruthless Prioritization.Bad Transition:❌ ""I’ll handle every request that comes in.""❌ ""Let’s add this to the backlog just in case."".Good Transition:✅ ""We’re focusing on what moves the needle, not what’s loudest.""✅ ""This aligns with our strategy—let’s prioritize it. That request? Not right now."".🛠 Pro Tip: If everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Learn to say no strategically..💠 Success Is About Outcomes, Not Outputs.Bad Transition:❌ ""We launched 10 features this quarter!""❌ ""The roadmap is 100% delivered—great job!"".Good Transition:✅ ""User engagement increased by 30% after we improved onboarding.""✅ ""Revenue grew 12% because of the pricing changes we introduced."".🛠 Pro Tip: No one cares how much you ship. They care what impact it had.

Tanya JoshiTanya Joshi,,"📌 Why Pandas & NumPy Are the Bread & Butter of Every Aspiring Data ProfessionalI once loaded a dataset of 100,000 rows into pure Python lists—and everything slowed to a crawl. Scripts took minutes, memory spiked, and debugging felt unbearable.That’s when I discovered NumPy and Pandas—power tools every aspiring Data Analyst and Engineer must master.⚡ NumPy = Speed Under the HoodNumPy (Numerical Python) is built for high-performance, vectorized operations on homogeneous arrays. It handles large numerical datasets insanely fast, thanks to its C-based implementation and memory-efficient design.Think: performing million-row mathematical operations in milliseconds instead of minutes—no native Python loops needed .🐼 Pandas = The Power Table for Real DataBuilt on NumPy, Pandas provides Series and DataFrames—intuitive, labeled structures ideal for real-world data handling. They let you import CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON; clean and wrangle data; aggregate; and reshape elegantly—all with built-in support for missing values and time-series data .🧩 Why You Should Learn Both:🔺 NumPy for faster numerical computation across large arrays.🔺 Pandas for handling structured, labeled, heterogeneous data and meaningful transformations .Pandas acts like an intuitive spreadsheet in code—while NumPy powers it invisibly under the hood.📊 Real-World Project Snapshot: Sales Data AnalysisI once combined a large sales table and customer info:1. Used NumPy arrays to efficiently compute aggregated transaction volumes.2. Shifted to Pandas DataFrames to merge customer segments and region metadata.3. Cleaned and handled missing entries, standardized formats, and grouped data by region using Pandas .groupby().4. Exported clean summaries for dashboard ingestion or modeling.The result?

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

Here’s the case for solving it.""✅ ""We ran an A/B test—Option A increased conversion by 18%. Let’s scale it."".🛠 Pro Tip: Your opinion doesn’t matter—the only thing that matters is customer needs and business impact..💠 You’re Accountable Without Having Authority.Bad Transition:❌ ""Engineering should build this because I said so.""❌ ""Design should just trust me—I know what’s best for the user."".Good Transition:✅ ""I aligned with stakeholders before the meeting so everyone is on the same page.""✅ ""Here’s how this fits our company goals and why solving it benefits us all."".🛠 Pro Tip: If you can’t influence without authority, you won’t survive as a PM..💠 Time Management = Ruthless Prioritization.Bad Transition:❌ ""I’ll handle every request that comes in.""❌ ""Let’s add this to the backlog just in case."".Good Transition:✅ ""We’re focusing on what moves the needle, not what’s loudest.""✅ ""This aligns with our strategy—let’s prioritize it. That request? Not right now."".🛠 Pro Tip: If everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Learn to say no strategically..💠 Success Is About Outcomes, Not Outputs.Bad Transition:❌ ""We launched 10 features this quarter!""❌ ""The roadmap is 100% delivered—great job!"".Good Transition:✅ ""User engagement increased by 30% after we improved onboarding.""✅ ""Revenue grew 12% because of the pricing changes we introduced."".🛠 Pro Tip: No one cares how much you ship. They care what impact it had.

Tanya JoshiTanya Joshi,,"📌 Why Pandas & NumPy Are the Bread & Butter of Every Aspiring Data ProfessionalI once loaded a dataset of 100,000 rows into pure Python lists—and everything slowed to a crawl. Scripts took minutes, memory spiked, and debugging felt unbearable.That’s when I discovered NumPy and Pandas—power tools every aspiring Data Analyst and Engineer must master.⚡ NumPy = Speed Under the HoodNumPy (Numerical Python) is built for high-performance, vectorized operations on homogeneous arrays. It handles large numerical datasets insanely fast, thanks to its C-based implementation and memory-efficient design.Think: performing million-row mathematical operations in milliseconds instead of minutes—no native Python loops needed .🐼 Pandas = The Power Table for Real DataBuilt on NumPy, Pandas provides Series and DataFrames—intuitive, labeled structures ideal for real-world data handling. They let you import CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON; clean and wrangle data; aggregate; and reshape elegantly—all with built-in support for missing values and time-series data .🧩 Why You Should Learn Both:🔺 NumPy for faster numerical computation across large arrays.🔺 Pandas for handling structured, labeled, heterogeneous data and meaningful transformations .Pandas acts like an intuitive spreadsheet in code—while NumPy powers it invisibly under the hood.📊 Real-World Project Snapshot: Sales Data AnalysisI once combined a large sales table and customer info:1. Used NumPy arrays to efficiently compute aggregated transaction volumes.2. Shifted to Pandas DataFrames to merge customer segments and region metadata.3. Cleaned and handled missing entries, standardized formats, and grouped data by region using Pandas .groupby().4. Exported clean summaries for dashboard ingestion or modeling.The result? Business-ready insight—prepared with clean, repeatable, efficient code.🔄 How Analysts & Engineers Use These Daily:-NumPy: numerical modeling, feature engineering, performance-sensitive transformations-Pandas: ETL data cleaning, merging, pivoting, group analysis, missing data handling-Use both in tandem—NumPy for speed, Pandas for structure and readability 🌱 Why This Matters on My JourneyAs someone growing in Data Science and Engineering, learning NumPy and Pandas has helped me:-Process datasets 10× faster-Clean and shape data with minimal effort-Build reusable, readable scripts that scale beyond spreadsheetsThey’re not just tools—they’re the foundation of professional data work.If you’re building working on data,preparing business reports,hiring or mentoring future data professionals,I’d love to connect and grow together🤝Let’s make data work smarter—one array and one DataFrame at a time.hashtag#Python hashtag#NumPy hashtag#Pandas hashtag#DataEngineering hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#LearningInPublic hashtag#ETL hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#WomenInTech hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#OpenToWork

Shivam ShrivastavaShivam Shrivastava,,"Why DSA Still Matters in the Age of AI?In an era where AI can write code, debug it, and explain it back to you - it’s tempting to believe that mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is no longer necessary.𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵:DSA is more relevant now than ever.And not just for interviews - but for keeping your mind sharp, independent, and resilient in a world of over-automation.A recent study by Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University raised serious concerns: • Heavy reliance on AI tools is weakening our critical thinking. • Researchers found that knowledge workers who leaned too much on AI began accepting its answers at face value - without applying independent judgment. • Only 36% of professionals said they used critical thinking to review AI-generated content. That’s a dangerous trend.𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴?AI is changing how we think.Instead of solving problems, we are often just reviewing AI’s solutions.That subtle shift might seem harmless, but it’s rewiring how we approach decisions and problems.This phenomenon is called 𝗰𝗼𝗴𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝘆.If your brain isn’t solving, iterating, and debugging regularly - it stops growing.Just like a muscle, use it or lose it.𝗦𝗼 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗳𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀?DSA isn’t just a hiring filter.It’s mental gym for engineers - a discipline that forces you to break down problems, think in edge cases, and build a clear, optimized approach from scratch.It teaches you: • How to think precisely • How to structure logic from zero • How to debug deeply without hallucinating answers • How to solve problems even when there’s no precedentThese are the exact skills that protect your mind from going soft in a world of AI autocomplete.The real dilemmaAs AI gets better, human critical thinking must get stronger.And yet, we’re seeing the opposite.People are outsourcing their thinking - trusting the first suggestion, skipping the fundamentals, forgetting how to question.That’s exactly where DSA becomes your edge.Not because it shows up in interviews.But because it gives you a mindset that outlasts tools.The future of tech doesn’t belong to those who use AI.It belongs to those who challenge it, supervise it, and go beyond it.𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗗𝗦𝗔 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 - 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘂𝘀𝗲.If you're preparing for data roles, ML, or engineering interviews, remember this:𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹.DSA is how you build it.AI can help you code.

It’s you. 😬📣 A/B testing job posts – Turns out “rockstar ninja” doesn’t bring actual engineers.🧠 Analyzing Glassdoor reviews like product feedback – Because “toxic” is not just a bad smell, it’s a retention risk.🧭 Mapping talent personas – Hiring isn’t one-size-fits-all. Neither is branding.📊 Measuring which content gets actual clicks – That fancy employer video?

Here’s the case for solving it.""✅ ""We ran an A/B test—Option A increased conversion by 18%. Let’s scale it."".🛠 Pro Tip: Your opinion doesn’t matter—the only thing that matters is customer needs and business impact..💠 You’re Accountable Without Having Authority.Bad Transition:❌ ""Engineering should build this because I said so.""❌ ""Design should just trust me—I know what’s best for the user."".Good Transition:✅ ""I aligned with stakeholders before the meeting so everyone is on the same page.""✅ ""Here’s how this fits our company goals and why solving it benefits us all."".🛠 Pro Tip: If you can’t influence without authority, you won’t survive as a PM..💠 Time Management = Ruthless Prioritization.Bad Transition:❌ ""I’ll handle every request that comes in.""❌ ""Let’s add this to the backlog just in case."".Good Transition:✅ ""We’re focusing on what moves the needle, not what’s loudest.""✅ ""This aligns with our strategy—let’s prioritize it. That request? Not right now."".🛠 Pro Tip: If everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Learn to say no strategically..💠 Success Is About Outcomes, Not Outputs.Bad Transition:❌ ""We launched 10 features this quarter!""❌ ""The roadmap is 100% delivered—great job!"".Good Transition:✅ ""User engagement increased by 30% after we improved onboarding.""✅ ""Revenue grew 12% because of the pricing changes we introduced."".🛠 Pro Tip: No one cares how much you ship. They care what impact it had.

Tanya JoshiTanya Joshi,,"📌 Why Pandas & NumPy Are the Bread & Butter of Every Aspiring Data ProfessionalI once loaded a dataset of 100,000 rows into pure Python lists—and everything slowed to a crawl. Scripts took minutes, memory spiked, and debugging felt unbearable.That’s when I discovered NumPy and Pandas—power tools every aspiring Data Analyst and Engineer must master.⚡ NumPy = Speed Under the HoodNumPy (Numerical Python) is built for high-performance, vectorized operations on homogeneous arrays. It handles large numerical datasets insanely fast, thanks to its C-based implementation and memory-efficient design.Think: performing million-row mathematical operations in milliseconds instead of minutes—no native Python loops needed .🐼 Pandas = The Power Table for Real DataBuilt on NumPy, Pandas provides Series and DataFrames—intuitive, labeled structures ideal for real-world data handling. They let you import CSV, Excel, SQL, and JSON; clean and wrangle data; aggregate; and reshape elegantly—all with built-in support for missing values and time-series data .🧩 Why You Should Learn Both:🔺 NumPy for faster numerical computation across large arrays.🔺 Pandas for handling structured, labeled, heterogeneous data and meaningful transformations .Pandas acts like an intuitive spreadsheet in code—while NumPy powers it invisibly under the hood.📊 Real-World Project Snapshot: Sales Data AnalysisI once combined a large sales table and customer info:1.
