I made it all the way to the final round, and although I didn’t receive an offer this time, I’m incredibly proud of the journey.Over the course of the process, I: 🔹 Solved live coding challenges in Java 🔹 Designed scalable systems with reliability and monitoring in mind 🔹 Collaborated with interviewers on incident response and infrastructure resilience scenarios 🔹 Strengthened my passion for building systems that are resilient, observable, and secure at scaleWhile the outcome wasn’t what I hoped for, the experience reinforced that I’m on the right path—and even more motivated to grow in the Cloud, DevOps, and SRE space.💡 If you’re working on similar challenges—or if your team is hiring in Cloud/SRE/DevOps—I’d love to connect and learn more.Onwards and upwards! 🚀📩 I’m open to roles across the U.S. and remote positions as well.Let’s build something that lasts. 💡hashtag#SRE hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CloudEngineering hashtag#SiteReliability hashtag#Observability hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#ReliabilityEngineering hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#CloudJobs hashtag#AWS hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Python hashtag#Monitoring hashtag#EngineeringJobs
