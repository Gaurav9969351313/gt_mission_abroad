Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign

Hritwika BanikHritwika Banik,,"Day 35/365 — API: Part 2Acknowledgement SudoCODE for System Design Playlist.API — ""Application Programming Interface""A — Application Multiple apps or services need to talk. API is the shared language.P — Programming APIs allow programs (not humans) to communicate — it’s all about automation and code-level interaction.I — Interface APIs expose only what’s necessary. Internal logic stays hidden — like giving users a steering wheel, not engine parts.Advantages of APIs- Communication: Systems can exchange data across networks or platforms.- Abstraction: Complexity is hidden behind clean interfaces.- Platform Agnostic: APIs work regardless of programming language or OS.- Faster Integration: Reuse existing services instead of reinventing them.Types of APIs1. Private APIs — Used internally within a company or team.2. Public APIs — Exposed to third-party developers (e.g., Twitter API).3. Web APIs — Delivered over the web using protocols like HTTP.4. Library APIs — Part of SDKs/libraries, consumed within your codebase.📌 What makes an API effective?- API Contracts: Clear input/output structure and rules that both sides follow.- Documentation: Easy to understand and up-to-date guides or examples.- Data Format: Common formats like JSON or XML ensure readability.- Security: APIs should be protected using tokens, keys, OAuth, rate limits, etc.Common API Standards- REST — Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), resource-focused, stateless.- SOAP — Older XML-based protocol with strict structure.- RPC — Remote Procedure Call; calls functions directly across networks.- GraphQL — Clients specify exactly what data they want in one request.Confusions:1. Can two apps in different languages work together? Yes — APIs define a common structure for communication.2. Can a Java backend talk to a JavaScript frontend? Yes — via APIs using protocols like HTTP and formats like JSON.3. Can the same API serve multiple apps? Yes — services become reusable across platforms or teams.4. Web API or Library API? If you're sending HTTP requests (e.g., to a backend or third-party), it's a Web API. If you're importing a package into your code (e.g., Python or JS library), it's a Library API.5. Internal or external API? Internal APIs are for use within your company or team. External APIs (e.g., Google Maps) are maintained by others and may have limits or terms.6. Is the API usable just by reading the docs? Good docs cover endpoints, examples, auth, and errors. Poor or outdated docs make onboarding harder.7. Public vs private APIs in your project? Public APIs are exposed externally — often with API keys and limits. Private APIs are internal and may not be hardened for public use. hashtag#API hashtag#Microservices hashtag#REST hashtag#WebAPI hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#DevJourney hashtag#LearnInPublic hashtag#systemDesign
