Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring

Bandara VikasBandara Vikas,,"Let me explain clearly:How an API works — in C# context An API (Application Programming Interface) is just a way for one program (or system) to talk to another in a standard way, usually over HTTP/HTTPS if it’s a web API.In C#, you often build Web APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.Basic Idea:A client (like Postman, a browser, or a mobile app) sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) to your API.Your API receives the request, processes it (maybe talks to a database or performs logic), and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON format.📌 Steps in C#:Create a Web API ProjectIn Visual Studio:File → New → Project → ASP.NET Core Web APIDefine a ControllerA controller is a C# class that defines the endpoints of your API.What happens when you run it:You run the API (dotnet run or press F5 in Visual Studio).The API listens on a URL like: https://localhost:5001You can send HTTP requests to endpoints like:GET /api/productsGET /api/products/1POST /api/productsTools to Test:Use Postman or browser for GET requests.For POST/PUT you can send JSON body via Postman.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#DotNet hashtag#MicroSoft hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#Fresher hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#Hiring
