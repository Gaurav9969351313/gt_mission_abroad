Edwin RooseveltEdwin Roosevelt,,"""We can just hire a few software engineers and train them on LLMs.""Haha I hear this a lot from fast-growing startups.It sounds good in theory.In practice? It rarely works.Why?-Fine tuning LLMs isn’t just writing better code, it’s a deep mix of ML theory, systems optimization, and data intuition.-Building an efficient LLM stack involves tokenization, embeddings, vector search, retrieval pipelines, and custom evaluation metrics.-LLM engineering isn't a “learn on the job” role at scale.Companies who treat LLM engineering like software engineering usually realize after 6+ months lost that expertise matters from day one.Hiring right the first time isn’t optional.

It rarely works.Why?-Fine tuning LLMs isn’t just writing better code, it’s a deep mix of ML theory, systems optimization, and data intuition.-Building an efficient LLM stack involves tokenization, embeddings, vector search, retrieval pipelines, and custom evaluation metrics.-LLM engineering isn't a “learn on the job” role at scale.Companies who treat LLM engineering like software engineering usually realize after 6+ months lost that expertise matters from day one.Hiring right the first time isn’t optional.

Shivani Pushkar JoshiShivani Pushkar Joshi,,"🚨 The Legal Business Analyst – A Role of the Future (That’s Already Here)Law and technology are no longer two separate islands. They're converging fast—and Legal Business Analysts are becoming the much-needed bridge.📍In the UK and US, Legal Business Analyst roles already exist. Law firms, in-house legal teams, legal tech startups, and compliance divisions are hiring professionals who understand legal processes, automation tools, business systems, and data-driven decision-making.Yet in many parts of the world—including India—this role is still emerging.So why did I create a roadmap and course for it?✅ Because legal professionals today need more than just domain knowledge. ✅ Because law firms are undergoing digital transformation, but lack professionals who can translate legal needs into business and tech solutions. ✅ Because roles like Legal Engineers, Legal Ops, and Legal Transformation Analysts are going to be mainstream in the next 2–3 years.But most importantly— I built this because I’ve seen law students, lawyers, and business analysts struggle to find a niche where they can grow without choosing between law and technology.This role is not just the future. It’s the present—just not evenly distributed yet.💡 If you’re curious about how this role works, what it looks like in real life, and how to step into it—I’ve built something that might help.

It rarely works.Why?-Fine tuning LLMs isn’t just writing better code, it’s a deep mix of ML theory, systems optimization, and data intuition.-Building an efficient LLM stack involves tokenization, embeddings, vector search, retrieval pipelines, and custom evaluation metrics.-LLM engineering isn't a “learn on the job” role at scale.Companies who treat LLM engineering like software engineering usually realize after 6+ months lost that expertise matters from day one.Hiring right the first time isn’t optional.

Shivani Pushkar JoshiShivani Pushkar Joshi,,"🚨 The Legal Business Analyst – A Role of the Future (That’s Already Here)Law and technology are no longer two separate islands. They're converging fast—and Legal Business Analysts are becoming the much-needed bridge.📍In the UK and US, Legal Business Analyst roles already exist. Law firms, in-house legal teams, legal tech startups, and compliance divisions are hiring professionals who understand legal processes, automation tools, business systems, and data-driven decision-making.Yet in many parts of the world—including India—this role is still emerging.So why did I create a roadmap and course for it?✅ Because legal professionals today need more than just domain knowledge. ✅ Because law firms are undergoing digital transformation, but lack professionals who can translate legal needs into business and tech solutions. ✅ Because roles like Legal Engineers, Legal Ops, and Legal Transformation Analysts are going to be mainstream in the next 2–3 years.But most importantly— I built this because I’ve seen law students, lawyers, and business analysts struggle to find a niche where they can grow without choosing between law and technology.This role is not just the future. It’s the present—just not evenly distributed yet.💡 If you’re curious about how this role works, what it looks like in real life, and how to step into it—I’ve built something that might help.

Edwin RooseveltEdwin Roosevelt,,"""We can just hire a few software engineers and train them on LLMs.""Haha I hear this a lot from fast-growing startups.It sounds good in theory.In practice? It rarely works.Why?-Fine tuning LLMs isn’t just writing better code, it’s a deep mix of ML theory, systems optimization, and data intuition.-Building an efficient LLM stack involves tokenization, embeddings, vector search, retrieval pipelines, and custom evaluation metrics.-LLM engineering isn't a “learn on the job” role at scale.Companies who treat LLM engineering like software engineering usually realize after 6+ months lost that expertise matters from day one.Hiring right the first time isn’t optional.

Shivani Pushkar JoshiShivani Pushkar Joshi,,"🚨 The Legal Business Analyst – A Role of the Future (That’s Already Here)Law and technology are no longer two separate islands. They're converging fast—and Legal Business Analysts are becoming the much-needed bridge.📍In the UK and US, Legal Business Analyst roles already exist. Law firms, in-house legal teams, legal tech startups, and compliance divisions are hiring professionals who understand legal processes, automation tools, business systems, and data-driven decision-making.Yet in many parts of the world—including India—this role is still emerging.So why did I create a roadmap and course for it?✅ Because legal professionals today need more than just domain knowledge. ✅ Because law firms are undergoing digital transformation, but lack professionals who can translate legal needs into business and tech solutions. ✅ Because roles like Legal Engineers, Legal Ops, and Legal Transformation Analysts are going to be mainstream in the next 2–3 years.But most importantly— I built this because I’ve seen law students, lawyers, and business analysts struggle to find a niche where they can grow without choosing between law and technology.This role is not just the future. It’s the present—just not evenly distributed yet.💡 If you’re curious about how this role works, what it looks like in real life, and how to step into it—I’ve built something that might help.

It rarely works.Why?-Fine tuning LLMs isn’t just writing better code, it’s a deep mix of ML theory, systems optimization, and data intuition.-Building an efficient LLM stack involves tokenization, embeddings, vector search, retrieval pipelines, and custom evaluation metrics.-LLM engineering isn't a “learn on the job” role at scale.Companies who treat LLM engineering like software engineering usually realize after 6+ months lost that expertise matters from day one.Hiring right the first time isn’t optional.

Shivani Pushkar JoshiShivani Pushkar Joshi,,"🚨 The Legal Business Analyst – A Role of the Future (That’s Already Here)Law and technology are no longer two separate islands. They're converging fast—and Legal Business Analysts are becoming the much-needed bridge.📍In the UK and US, Legal Business Analyst roles already exist. Law firms, in-house legal teams, legal tech startups, and compliance divisions are hiring professionals who understand legal processes, automation tools, business systems, and data-driven decision-making.Yet in many parts of the world—including India—this role is still emerging.So why did I create a roadmap and course for it?✅ Because legal professionals today need more than just domain knowledge. ✅ Because law firms are undergoing digital transformation, but lack professionals who can translate legal needs into business and tech solutions. ✅ Because roles like Legal Engineers, Legal Ops, and Legal Transformation Analysts are going to be mainstream in the next 2–3 years.But most importantly— I built this because I’ve seen law students, lawyers, and business analysts struggle to find a niche where they can grow without choosing between law and technology.This role is not just the future. It’s the present—just not evenly distributed yet.💡 If you’re curious about how this role works, what it looks like in real life, and how to step into it—I’ve built something that might help.

Edwin RooseveltEdwin Roosevelt,,"""We can just hire a few software engineers and train them on LLMs.""Haha I hear this a lot from fast-growing startups.It sounds good in theory.In practice? It rarely works.Why?-Fine tuning LLMs isn’t just writing better code, it’s a deep mix of ML theory, systems optimization, and data intuition.-Building an efficient LLM stack involves tokenization, embeddings, vector search, retrieval pipelines, and custom evaluation metrics.-LLM engineering isn't a “learn on the job” role at scale.Companies who treat LLM engineering like software engineering usually realize after 6+ months lost that expertise matters from day one.Hiring right the first time isn’t optional.

Shivani Pushkar JoshiShivani Pushkar Joshi,,"🚨 The Legal Business Analyst – A Role of the Future (That’s Already Here)Law and technology are no longer two separate islands. They're converging fast—and Legal Business Analysts are becoming the much-needed bridge.📍In the UK and US, Legal Business Analyst roles already exist. Law firms, in-house legal teams, legal tech startups, and compliance divisions are hiring professionals who understand legal processes, automation tools, business systems, and data-driven decision-making.Yet in many parts of the world—including India—this role is still emerging.So why did I create a roadmap and course for it?✅ Because legal professionals today need more than just domain knowledge. ✅ Because law firms are undergoing digital transformation, but lack professionals who can translate legal needs into business and tech solutions. ✅ Because roles like Legal Engineers, Legal Ops, and Legal Transformation Analysts are going to be mainstream in the next 2–3 years.But most importantly— I built this because I’ve seen law students, lawyers, and business analysts struggle to find a niche where they can grow without choosing between law and technology.This role is not just the future. It’s the present—just not evenly distributed yet.💡 If you’re curious about how this role works, what it looks like in real life, and how to step into it—I’ve built something that might help.

It rarely works.Why?-Fine tuning LLMs isn’t just writing better code, it’s a deep mix of ML theory, systems optimization, and data intuition.-Building an efficient LLM stack involves tokenization, embeddings, vector search, retrieval pipelines, and custom evaluation metrics.-LLM engineering isn't a “learn on the job” role at scale.Companies who treat LLM engineering like software engineering usually realize after 6+ months lost that expertise matters from day one.Hiring right the first time isn’t optional.

Shivani Pushkar JoshiShivani Pushkar Joshi,,"🚨 The Legal Business Analyst – A Role of the Future (That’s Already Here)Law and technology are no longer two separate islands. They're converging fast—and Legal Business Analysts are becoming the much-needed bridge.📍In the UK and US, Legal Business Analyst roles already exist. Law firms, in-house legal teams, legal tech startups, and compliance divisions are hiring professionals who understand legal processes, automation tools, business systems, and data-driven decision-making.Yet in many parts of the world—including India—this role is still emerging.So why did I create a roadmap and course for it?✅ Because legal professionals today need more than just domain knowledge. ✅ Because law firms are undergoing digital transformation, but lack professionals who can translate legal needs into business and tech solutions. ✅ Because roles like Legal Engineers, Legal Ops, and Legal Transformation Analysts are going to be mainstream in the next 2–3 years.But most importantly— I built this because I’ve seen law students, lawyers, and business analysts struggle to find a niche where they can grow without choosing between law and technology.This role is not just the future. It’s the present—just not evenly distributed yet.💡 If you’re curious about how this role works, what it looks like in real life, and how to step into it—I’ve built something that might help. DM me and I’ll share it with you.hashtag#LegalTech hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#LegalTransformation hashtag#CareerInLaw hashtag#LegalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfLaw hashtag#LegalBusinessAnalyst
