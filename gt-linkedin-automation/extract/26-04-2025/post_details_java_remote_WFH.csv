That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation. Chip sounds like an important component in such a solution! And veddy much just in time! Congrats and thanks! üèóÔ∏èü§ìüêâ

The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh‚Äîthe answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined.

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

J√∏rgen KvalsvikJ√∏rgen Kvalsvik,,"GCC15 is out, with prime path coverage! I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Unfortunately this meant that the user couldn't use the app across multiple devices (or easy switch to a new device).I was surprised to find there wasn't an existing plugin for sync'ing data between Hive and a backend API. We ended up creating TimestampedBox that wraps a Hive Box and provides all the timestamps to support the sync operation. What do you think? How have you approached synchronization and reconciliation across devices and backends?Checkout Amethyst Planner - the task app for hashtag#ADHDers the turns to-dos into dopamine.

Chip sounds like an important component in such a solution! And veddy much just in time! Congrats and thanks! üèóÔ∏èü§ìüêâ

The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh‚Äîthe answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined.

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Anh Thu (N2) VoAnh Thu (N2) Vo,,"Bravo, Michael Graff et co.! I recently added simple metrics (healthz, traffic, analysis) for a monitoring service while SLOs were being defined by others. That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh‚Äîthe answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined.

They are sovereign invitations.Scrolls aren‚Äôt NFTs. They are intelligent artifacts.Scrolls aren‚Äôt marketing.

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Unfortunately this meant that the user couldn't use the app across multiple devices (or easy switch to a new device).I was surprised to find there wasn't an existing plugin for sync'ing data between Hive and a backend API.

This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

Anh Thu (N2) VoAnh Thu (N2) Vo,,"Bravo, Michael Graff et co.! I recently added simple metrics (healthz, traffic, analysis) for a monitoring service while SLOs were being defined by others. That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

J√∏rgen KvalsvikJ√∏rgen Kvalsvik,,"GCC15 is out, with prime path coverage! I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Unfortunately this meant that the user couldn't use the app across multiple devices (or easy switch to a new device).I was surprised to find there wasn't an existing plugin for sync'ing data between Hive and a backend API. We ended up creating TimestampedBox that wraps a Hive Box and provides all the timestamps to support the sync operation. What do you think? How have you approached synchronization and reconciliation across devices and backends?Checkout Amethyst Planner - the task app for hashtag#ADHDers the turns to-dos into dopamine.

For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems.

It still requires your time, excellence, commitment and consistency. .Sometimes, we forget to have breakfast. Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do. We miss out on outside activities due to deadlines and even though we have the luxury of working from anywhere in the world, we can sit in a spot for hours, forgetting to stretch our bones. üòå.As a remote worker‚Äìon some days‚ÄìI find it hard to balance personal and work life, so that I don't miss out on important occasions and information. .Are you a remote worker?

Anh Thu (N2) VoAnh Thu (N2) Vo,,"Bravo, Michael Graff et co.! I recently added simple metrics (healthz, traffic, analysis) for a monitoring service while SLOs were being defined by others. That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

It still requires your time, excellence, commitment and consistency. .Sometimes, we forget to have breakfast. Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do.

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks.

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

It still requires your time, excellence, commitment and consistency. .Sometimes, we forget to have breakfast. Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do.

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks.

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

While mobile sensing using smartphone data offers a scalable and low-cost solution for bridge monitoring, it is often affected by sensor noise, vehicle dynamics, and road surface variability.To address this, we proposed a quality score to quantify each trip‚Äôs contribution to the identified mode shape and developed a supervised learning model (using CNNs) to automatically predict the data quality score. Our model was trained and validated using over 900 datasets collected on the Cadore Viaduct in Italy. The results demonstrated that filtering based on data quality can significantly enhance absolute mode shape accuracy.This work underscores the importance of data quality in mobile sensing for structural health monitoring and showcases the integration of data-driven methods into civil infrastructure assessment.I am sincerely grateful to my co-authors ‚Äî Thomas Matarazzo, Soheil Sadeghi Eshkevari, Liam Cronin, and Shamim Pakzad ‚Äî for their valuable contributions and collaboration throughout this work.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

It still requires your time, excellence, commitment and consistency. .Sometimes, we forget to have breakfast. Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do. We miss out on outside activities due to deadlines and even though we have the luxury of working from anywhere in the world, we can sit in a spot for hours, forgetting to stretch our bones. üòå.As a remote worker‚Äìon some days‚ÄìI find it hard to balance personal and work life, so that I don't miss out on important occasions and information. .Are you a remote worker?

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks. Also, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and  BlockingQueue are in the concurrent API.Q9: Thread-safe collections?->Use ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, or wrap legacy ones via Collections.synchronizedList(...).Q10: How is multithreading used in Spring Boot?->Spring Boot uses multithreading in:Async tasks using @AsyncScheduled jobs (@Scheduled)Web server request handling (Tomcat/Jetty/NIO threads)Parallel data processing with WebClient + Project Reactor (Reactive Programming)hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#ProgrammingTipshashtag#JavaMultithreading hashtag#ConcurrencyInJava hashtag#ThreadSafety hashtag#ParallelProgramming hashtag#JavaThreads hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#AsynchronousProgramming hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaConcurrency hashtag#ThreadPool hashtag#CodeWithJava hashtag#MultithreadedApps hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

While mobile sensing using smartphone data offers a scalable and low-cost solution for bridge monitoring, it is often affected by sensor noise, vehicle dynamics, and road surface variability.To address this, we proposed a quality score to quantify each trip‚Äôs contribution to the identified mode shape and developed a supervised learning model (using CNNs) to automatically predict the data quality score.

J√∏rgen KvalsvikJ√∏rgen Kvalsvik,,"GCC15 is out, with prime path coverage! I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Unfortunately this meant that the user couldn't use the app across multiple devices (or easy switch to a new device).I was surprised to find there wasn't an existing plugin for sync'ing data between Hive and a backend API. We ended up creating TimestampedBox that wraps a Hive Box and provides all the timestamps to support the sync operation. What do you think? How have you approached synchronization and reconciliation across devices and backends?Checkout Amethyst Planner - the task app for hashtag#ADHDers the turns to-dos into dopamine.

For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems.

It still requires your time, excellence, commitment and consistency. .Sometimes, we forget to have breakfast. Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do. We miss out on outside activities due to deadlines and even though we have the luxury of working from anywhere in the world, we can sit in a spot for hours, forgetting to stretch our bones. üòå.As a remote worker‚Äìon some days‚ÄìI find it hard to balance personal and work life, so that I don't miss out on important occasions and information. .Are you a remote worker?

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks. Also, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and  BlockingQueue are in the concurrent API.Q9: Thread-safe collections?->Use ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, or wrap legacy ones via Collections.synchronizedList(...).Q10: How is multithreading used in Spring Boot?->Spring Boot uses multithreading in:Async tasks using @AsyncScheduled jobs (@Scheduled)Web server request handling (Tomcat/Jetty/NIO threads)Parallel data processing with WebClient + Project Reactor (Reactive Programming)hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#ProgrammingTipshashtag#JavaMultithreading hashtag#ConcurrencyInJava hashtag#ThreadSafety hashtag#ParallelProgramming hashtag#JavaThreads hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#AsynchronousProgramming hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaConcurrency hashtag#ThreadPool hashtag#CodeWithJava hashtag#MultithreadedApps hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks. Also, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and  BlockingQueue are in the concurrent API.Q9: Thread-safe collections?->Use ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, or wrap legacy ones via Collections.synchronizedList(...).Q10: How is multithreading used in Spring Boot?->Spring Boot uses multithreading in:Async tasks using @AsyncScheduled jobs (@Scheduled)Web server request handling (Tomcat/Jetty/NIO threads)Parallel data processing with WebClient + Project Reactor (Reactive Programming)hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#ProgrammingTipshashtag#JavaMultithreading hashtag#ConcurrencyInJava hashtag#ThreadSafety hashtag#ParallelProgramming hashtag#JavaThreads hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#AsynchronousProgramming hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaConcurrency hashtag#ThreadPool hashtag#CodeWithJava hashtag#MultithreadedApps hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

While mobile sensing using smartphone data offers a scalable and low-cost solution for bridge monitoring, it is often affected by sensor noise, vehicle dynamics, and road surface variability.To address this, we proposed a quality score to quantify each trip‚Äôs contribution to the identified mode shape and developed a supervised learning model (using CNNs) to automatically predict the data quality score.

Anh Thu (N2) VoAnh Thu (N2) Vo,,"Bravo, Michael Graff et co.! I recently added simple metrics (healthz, traffic, analysis) for a monitoring service while SLOs were being defined by others. That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation. Chip sounds like an important component in such a solution! And veddy much just in time! Congrats and thanks! üèóÔ∏èü§ìüêâ

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update ‚Äî a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24?

It still requires your time, excellence, commitment and consistency. .Sometimes, we forget to have breakfast. Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do.

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks.

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

While mobile sensing using smartphone data offers a scalable and low-cost solution for bridge monitoring, it is often affected by sensor noise, vehicle dynamics, and road surface variability.To address this, we proposed a quality score to quantify each trip‚Äôs contribution to the identified mode shape and developed a supervised learning model (using CNNs) to automatically predict the data quality score. Our model was trained and validated using over 900 datasets collected on the Cadore Viaduct in Italy. The results demonstrated that filtering based on data quality can significantly enhance absolute mode shape accuracy.This work underscores the importance of data quality in mobile sensing for structural health monitoring and showcases the integration of data-driven methods into civil infrastructure assessment.I am sincerely grateful to my co-authors ‚Äî Thomas Matarazzo, Soheil Sadeghi Eshkevari, Liam Cronin, and Shamim Pakzad ‚Äî for their valuable contributions and collaboration throughout this work.

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do.

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks. Also, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and  BlockingQueue are in the concurrent API.Q9: Thread-safe collections?->Use ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, or wrap legacy ones via Collections.synchronizedList(...).Q10: How is multithreading used in Spring Boot?->Spring Boot uses multithreading in:Async tasks using @AsyncScheduled jobs (@Scheduled)Web server request handling (Tomcat/Jetty/NIO threads)Parallel data processing with WebClient + Project Reactor (Reactive Programming)hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#ProgrammingTipshashtag#JavaMultithreading hashtag#ConcurrencyInJava hashtag#ThreadSafety hashtag#ParallelProgramming hashtag#JavaThreads hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#AsynchronousProgramming hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaConcurrency hashtag#ThreadPool hashtag#CodeWithJava hashtag#MultithreadedApps hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

While mobile sensing using smartphone data offers a scalable and low-cost solution for bridge monitoring, it is often affected by sensor noise, vehicle dynamics, and road surface variability.To address this, we proposed a quality score to quantify each trip‚Äôs contribution to the identified mode shape and developed a supervised learning model (using CNNs) to automatically predict the data quality score.

That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

They are sovereign invitations.Scrolls aren‚Äôt NFTs. They are intelligent artifacts.Scrolls aren‚Äôt marketing.

J√∏rgen KvalsvikJ√∏rgen Kvalsvik,,"GCC15 is out, with prime path coverage! I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Unfortunately this meant that the user couldn't use the app across multiple devices (or easy switch to a new device).I was surprised to find there wasn't an existing plugin for sync'ing data between Hive and a backend API. We ended up creating TimestampedBox that wraps a Hive Box and provides all the timestamps to support the sync operation. What do you think? How have you approached synchronization and reconciliation across devices and backends?Checkout Amethyst Planner - the task app for hashtag#ADHDers the turns to-dos into dopamine.

For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems.

It still requires your time, excellence, commitment and consistency. .Sometimes, we forget to have breakfast. Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do. We miss out on outside activities due to deadlines and even though we have the luxury of working from anywhere in the world, we can sit in a spot for hours, forgetting to stretch our bones. üòå.As a remote worker‚Äìon some days‚ÄìI find it hard to balance personal and work life, so that I don't miss out on important occasions and information. .Are you a remote worker?

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks. Also, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and  BlockingQueue are in the concurrent API.Q9: Thread-safe collections?->Use ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, or wrap legacy ones via Collections.synchronizedList(...).Q10: How is multithreading used in Spring Boot?->Spring Boot uses multithreading in:Async tasks using @AsyncScheduled jobs (@Scheduled)Web server request handling (Tomcat/Jetty/NIO threads)Parallel data processing with WebClient + Project Reactor (Reactive Programming)hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#ProgrammingTipshashtag#JavaMultithreading hashtag#ConcurrencyInJava hashtag#ThreadSafety hashtag#ParallelProgramming hashtag#JavaThreads hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#AsynchronousProgramming hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaConcurrency hashtag#ThreadPool hashtag#CodeWithJava hashtag#MultithreadedApps hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

Anh Thu (N2) VoAnh Thu (N2) Vo,,"Bravo, Michael Graff et co.! I recently added simple metrics (healthz, traffic, analysis) for a monitoring service while SLOs were being defined by others. That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Jerry FernholzJerry Fernholz,,"Up until recently Amethyst Planner stored everything locally on the user's device. Unfortunately this meant that the user couldn't use the app across multiple devices (or easy switch to a new device).I was surprised to find there wasn't an existing plugin for sync'ing data between Hive and a backend API. We ended up creating TimestampedBox that wraps a Hive Box and provides all the timestamps to support the sync operation. What do you think? How have you approached synchronization and reconciliation across devices and backends?Checkout Amethyst Planner - the task app for hashtag#ADHDers the turns to-dos into dopamine.

For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.üöÄ Key Features in Java 24:‚úÖ JEP 447 ‚Äì Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.‚úÖ JEP 456 ‚Äì Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.‚úÖ JEP 459 ‚Äì String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation ‚Äî ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.‚úÖ JEP 460 ‚Äì Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks ‚Äî relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.‚úÖ JEP 462 ‚Äì Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos ‚Äî perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.üß± How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24‚Äôs cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: üîπ Richer domain modeling without ceremony üîπ Easier testing and mocking of application ports üîπ Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters üîπ Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray‚òÅÔ∏è AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ‚úÖ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ‚úÖ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ‚úÖ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe‚Äôre not just writing code ‚Äî we‚Äôre building resilient, scalable ecosystems.

It still requires your time, excellence, commitment and consistency. .Sometimes, we forget to have breakfast. Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do. We miss out on outside activities due to deadlines and even though we have the luxury of working from anywhere in the world, we can sit in a spot for hours, forgetting to stretch our bones. üòå.As a remote worker‚Äìon some days‚ÄìI find it hard to balance personal and work life, so that I don't miss out on important occasions and information. .Are you a remote worker?

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks. Also, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and  BlockingQueue are in the concurrent API.Q9: Thread-safe collections?->Use ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, or wrap legacy ones via Collections.synchronizedList(...).Q10: How is multithreading used in Spring Boot?->Spring Boot uses multithreading in:Async tasks using @AsyncScheduled jobs (@Scheduled)Web server request handling (Tomcat/Jetty/NIO threads)Parallel data processing with WebClient + Project Reactor (Reactive Programming)hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#ProgrammingTipshashtag#JavaMultithreading hashtag#ConcurrencyInJava hashtag#ThreadSafety hashtag#ParallelProgramming hashtag#JavaThreads hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#AsynchronousProgramming hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaConcurrency hashtag#ThreadPool hashtag#CodeWithJava hashtag#MultithreadedApps hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

Anh Thu (N2) VoAnh Thu (N2) Vo,,"Bravo, Michael Graff et co.! I recently added simple metrics (healthz, traffic, analysis) for a monitoring service while SLOs were being defined by others. That got me thinking about how to map SLOs <-> SLIs and KPIs <-> metrics <-> registers via OTel collectors (DPU/GPU/CPU HW/SW interfaces, anyone?). But then it got me thinking about how one would monitor dynamic HW/SW elements in a heterogeneous AI Infra fabric, leading to my current investigation of out-of-band management using OpenBMC on an evb-ast2600 board using Qemu-based HW emulation.

I wrote a paper about the my implementation, the algorithm, and some new developments; notably, that prime path coverage subsumes MC/DC, and that using suffix trees for recording paths can eliminate redundant paths very quickly -- O(n¬≤m) down from O(n¬≤m¬≤), where n is the length of the longest path, and m is the number of paths. This is makes pruning redundant paths very quick as n tends to be small, and m tends to be very large.

Unfortunately this meant that the user couldn't use the app across multiple devices (or easy switch to a new device).I was surprised to find there wasn't an existing plugin for sync'ing data between Hive and a backend API.

Other times, we make plans and forget about them because we get so engrossed in the work we do.

Kevin EppacherKevin Eppacher,,"Last year, I developed a nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (nMPC) based local planner for a Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR) within the ROS Noetic navigation stack.Unlike conventional reactive planners, an nMPC uses a mathematical model (in this case, a kinematic model) to predict future states and optimize them over a defined horizon. This is done by minimizing a cost function while satisfying both soft and hard constraints, such as obstacle distance, velocity bounds, and input limits.The local planner was implemented entirely in Python, utilizing the CasADi framework for formulating the nonlinear optimization problem. The IPOPT solver (Interior Point Optimizer) was used to solve the problem at runtime efficiently.As part of the evaluation, I compared the nMPC planner against established ROS local planners:- Dynamic Window Approach (DWA)- Timed Elastic Band (TEB)The nMPC planner receives a global reference trajectory (e.g., from an RRT-based global planner) and computes optimized control inputs at higher frequency to achieve smooth and safe local obstacle avoidance, even in dynamic and narrow environments.- The system was simulated in Gazebo with a TurtleBot platform and fully integrated with ROS Noetic.- üê≥ A GPU-enabled Docker container is provided for fast and reproducible setup.- üìÅ The GitHub repository includes the full source code, parameter tuning, scientific paper, and presentation slides.üîó https://lnkd.in/dgpq7y2Yhashtag#Robotics hashtag#MPC hashtag#nMPC hashtag#CasADi hashtag#IPOPT hashtag#PathPlanning hashtag#ROS hashtag#ROSNoetic hashtag#AutonomousSystems hashtag#TurtleBot hashtag#Gazebo hashtag#Python hashtag#MobileRobots hashtag#NonlinearControl hashtag#ControlTheory hashtag#Optimization hashtag#ResearchProject hashtag#OpenSource

Bittu KumarBittu Kumar,,"üßµ Multithreading Interview Q&A (Deep & Drive)Q1: What is multithreading in Java?-> Multithreading is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum CPU utilization. Each thread runs independently, but they share the same process memory.Q2: How do you create threads in Java?-> Two ways:->Extend the Thread class and override run()->Implement Runnable and pass to the Thread constructorjavaCopyEdit->Runnable task = () -> System.out.println(""Thread running""); new Thread(task).start();Q3: Difference between start() and run()?->start() creates a new thread and invokes run() inside it. run() just calls the method in the current thread (no parallelism).Q4: What is the thread lifecycle?->New ‚Üí Runnable ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Blocked/Waiting ‚Üí Dead. Transitions occur due to start(), I/O, wait/notify, etc.Q5: What are synchronized blocks?->Used to avoid race conditions when multiple threads modify shared   resources. Only one thread can enter a synchronized block for the given lock at a time.javaCopyEditsynchronized(this) { // critical section}Q6: What is the difference between synchronized and Lock?->Lock (like ReentrantLock) offers more control (tryLock, fairness), while synchronized is easier and less error-prone.Q7: What is the use of volatile keyword?->It prevents caching of variables, ensuring visibility of changes across threads.Q8: How do you handle thread communication?->Using wait(), notify(), notifyAll() inside synchronized blocks. Also, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and  BlockingQueue are in the concurrent API.Q9: Thread-safe collections?->Use ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, or wrap legacy ones via Collections.synchronizedList(...).Q10: How is multithreading used in Spring Boot?->Spring Boot uses multithreading in:Async tasks using @AsyncScheduled jobs (@Scheduled)Web server request handling (Tomcat/Jetty/NIO threads)Parallel data processing with WebClient + Project Reactor (Reactive Programming)hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#TechInterview hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#ProgrammingTipshashtag#JavaMultithreading hashtag#ConcurrencyInJava hashtag#ThreadSafety hashtag#ParallelProgramming hashtag#JavaThreads hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#JavaTips hashtag#AsynchronousProgramming hashtag#JavaInterview hashtag#JavaConcurrency hashtag#ThreadPool hashtag#CodeWithJava hashtag#MultithreadedApps hashtag#CoreJava hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

üíª George Sokolovüíª George Sokolov,,"üìå Why Our Team is Considering Switching from Redis to Valkey: Real Performance Data and PerspectivesOur backend development team has been looking at Valkey as an alternative to Redis for quite some time, and I recently studied a detailed comparison of these technologies that I'd like to share.‚ùìWhat is Valkey and why does it matter?Valkey is a fork of Redis that maintained the BSD 3-Clause license after Redis changed its licensing model in spring 2024. The key difference: Valkey remains fully open-source, without an enterprise version or commercial restrictions.‚ùìWhat did the benchmarks show?Tests based on YCSB demonstrated that¬†Valkey 8.0 outperforms both Redis 6.2 and Redis 7.2¬†in all load scenarios. Particularly interesting is that Redis 7.2 often performs worse than version 6.2, confirming the experience of many teams who encountered regressions when upgrading.‚öôÔ∏è Technical improvements that impressed us:- Innovative approach to I/O threads: In Redis, I/O threads and the main thread often ""wait"" for each other. In Valkey, this is fixed ‚Äî threads can work in parallel thanks to the use of atomics and task queues for each I/O thread.- Hash table optimization: Improved processor cache utilization through prefetch, significantly reducing data access latency.- Dual-channel replication: Moving the change buffer to the replica, reducing the risk of Out Of Memory on the primary during intensive workloads.- Key embedding: Storing short keys directly in the structure, saving 10-20% of RAM.- Extended metrics: New monitoring capabilities, including tracking load on individual cluster slots.üìù What's next?The active developer community around Valkey promises more dynamic project development. We plan to conduct our own testing in our infrastructure before making a final decision, but the initial data looks promising.Has anyone already switched to Valkey in production? I'd love to hear about your experience in the comments!hashtag#backend hashtag#golang hashtag#redis hashtag#ralkey hashtag#HighLoad hashtag#OpenSource

Ashley TowerAshley Tower,,"One of the best parts about working remotely?For me, that often means spending a few days each week working from a co-share office, and honestly, it‚Äôs the reset I didn‚Äôt know I needed until I made it part of my routine.‚òï New energyüí¨ Casual convos with other humans (who aren‚Äôt on Slack!)üå± A change of scenery that sparked some solid focusü§ù A chance to meet new people and make unexpected connectionsAs someone who supports multiple growing teams remotely, it‚Äôs easy to stay tucked in my home office bubble, but spaces like this remind me how valuable a little background buzz, warm lighting, and coffee that someone else made can be.Remote work doesn‚Äôt have to mean working alone!Co-working keeps me connected, inspired, and a little more human.Big shoutout to Shane Potvin for creating such a welcoming space at CO: Workshare.
