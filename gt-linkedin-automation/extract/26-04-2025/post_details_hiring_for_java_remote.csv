Emmanuel NwosuEmmanuel Nwosu,,"Can you really get hired from anywhere in the world?As I learnt, it's one of the toughest questions to answer in the recruitment world. The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh—the answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined.

Emmanuel NwosuEmmanuel Nwosu,,"Can you really get hired from anywhere in the world?As I learnt, it's one of the toughest questions to answer in the recruitment world. The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh—the answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined. What are the odds for Africans living and working from the continent?I talk about it here: https://lnkd.in/dRwmT3V7What's your experience with ""location-adjusted"" pay?

Emmanuel NwosuEmmanuel Nwosu,,"Can you really get hired from anywhere in the world?As I learnt, it's one of the toughest questions to answer in the recruitment world. The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh—the answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined.

The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh—the answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined.

Emmanuel NwosuEmmanuel Nwosu,,"Can you really get hired from anywhere in the world?As I learnt, it's one of the toughest questions to answer in the recruitment world. The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh—the answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined. What are the odds for Africans living and working from the continent?I talk about it here: https://lnkd.in/dRwmT3V7What's your experience with ""location-adjusted"" pay?

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update — a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.🚀 Key Features in Java 24:✅ JEP 447 – Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.✅ JEP 456 – Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.✅ JEP 459 – String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation — ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.✅ JEP 460 – Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks — relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.✅ JEP 462 – Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos — perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.🧱 How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24’s cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: 🔹 Richer domain modeling without ceremony 🔹 Easier testing and mocking of application ports 🔹 Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters 🔹 Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray☁️ AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ✅ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ✅ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ✅ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe’re not just writing code — we’re building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24? What’s your favorite improvement so far?hashtag#Java24 hashtag#HexagonalArchitecture hashtag#DDD hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#Innovation hashtag#BackendEngineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBR

Emmanuel NwosuEmmanuel Nwosu,,"Can you really get hired from anywhere in the world?As I learnt, it's one of the toughest questions to answer in the recruitment world. The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh—the answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined. What are the odds for Africans living and working from the continent?I talk about it here: https://lnkd.in/dRwmT3V7What's your experience with ""location-adjusted"" pay?

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update — a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.🚀 Key Features in Java 24:✅ JEP 447 – Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.✅ JEP 456 – Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.✅ JEP 459 – String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation — ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.✅ JEP 460 – Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks — relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.✅ JEP 462 – Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos — perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.🧱 How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24’s cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: 🔹 Richer domain modeling without ceremony 🔹 Easier testing and mocking of application ports 🔹 Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters 🔹 Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray☁️ AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ✅ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ✅ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ✅ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe’re not just writing code — we’re building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24? What’s your favorite improvement so far?hashtag#Java24 hashtag#HexagonalArchitecture hashtag#DDD hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#Innovation hashtag#BackendEngineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBR

Emmanuel NwosuEmmanuel Nwosu,,"Can you really get hired from anywhere in the world?As I learnt, it's one of the toughest questions to answer in the recruitment world. The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh—the answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update — a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.🚀 Key Features in Java 24:✅ JEP 447 – Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.✅ JEP 456 – Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.✅ JEP 459 – String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation — ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.✅ JEP 460 – Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks — relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.✅ JEP 462 – Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos — perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.🧱 How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24’s cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: 🔹 Richer domain modeling without ceremony 🔹 Easier testing and mocking of application ports 🔹 Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters 🔹 Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray☁️ AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ✅ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ✅ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ✅ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe’re not just writing code — we’re building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24? What’s your favorite improvement so far?hashtag#Java24 hashtag#HexagonalArchitecture hashtag#DDD hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#Innovation hashtag#BackendEngineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBR

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update — a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.🚀 Key Features in Java 24:✅ JEP 447 – Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.✅ JEP 456 – Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.✅ JEP 459 – String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation — ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.✅ JEP 460 – Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks — relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.✅ JEP 462 – Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos — perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.🧱 How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24’s cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: 🔹 Richer domain modeling without ceremony 🔹 Easier testing and mocking of application ports 🔹 Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters 🔹 Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray☁️ AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ✅ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ✅ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ✅ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe’re not just writing code — we’re building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24? What’s your favorite improvement so far?hashtag#Java24 hashtag#HexagonalArchitecture hashtag#DDD hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#Innovation hashtag#BackendEngineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBR

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update — a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.🚀 Key Features in Java 24:✅ JEP 447 – Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.✅ JEP 456 – Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.✅ JEP 459 – String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation — ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.✅ JEP 460 – Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks — relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.✅ JEP 462 – Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos — perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.🧱 How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24’s cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: 🔹 Richer domain modeling without ceremony 🔹 Easier testing and mocking of application ports 🔹 Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters 🔹 Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray☁️ AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ✅ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ✅ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ✅ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe’re not just writing code — we’re building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24? What’s your favorite improvement so far?hashtag#Java24 hashtag#HexagonalArchitecture hashtag#DDD hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#Innovation hashtag#BackendEngineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBR

The details are fuzzy, bias is always seeping into the supposedly fair assessment of equal employment opportunities (spoiler alert!), and we sort of... just roll with the punches in Africa.I enjoyed exploring this question with knowledgeable folks and wonderful community who shared their experiences with me, and pitched this story in the first place.Let's make Digital Nomads even better.I'm looking to explore more topical issues around housing, economy, and tech in African hubs and how nomads impact these different dimensions.Let's talk hashtag#Nomads; send a message.And oh—the answer to the question I opened with is more systemic and rather circumstantial than I'd imagined.

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update — a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.🚀 Key Features in Java 24:✅ JEP 447 – Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.✅ JEP 456 – Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.✅ JEP 459 – String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation — ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.✅ JEP 460 – Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks — relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.✅ JEP 462 – Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos — perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.🧱 How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24’s cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: 🔹 Richer domain modeling without ceremony 🔹 Easier testing and mocking of application ports 🔹 Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters 🔹 Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray☁️ AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ✅ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ✅ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ✅ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe’re not just writing code — we’re building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24? What’s your favorite improvement so far?hashtag#Java24 hashtag#HexagonalArchitecture hashtag#DDD hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#Innovation hashtag#BackendEngineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBR

Fabio MouraFabio Moura,,"Java 24: More than an update — a powerful step forward for modern software architecture. hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBRWith the official release of Java 24, Oracle continues to evolve the platform in ways that directly support today's demands for scalability, modularity, and cloud-native design. For professionals like me who architect systems with Hexagonal Architecture (DDD) and deploy on AWS, this release brings substantial benefits.🚀 Key Features in Java 24:✅ JEP 447 – Statements before super(...) Allows initialization logic before calling the superclass constructor. This enhances flexibility in rich domain models and simplifies base-class inheritance patterns in DDD.✅ JEP 456 – Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Preview) Reduces boilerplate when using pattern matching, making business logic cleaner and more expressive.✅ JEP 459 – String Templates (Second Preview) Provides safe and efficient string interpolation — ideal for building dynamic responses, configurations, and messages without complex concatenation.✅ JEP 460 – Vector API (7th Incubator) Enables data-parallel operations for better performance in compute-heavy tasks — relevant for analytics or event-driven systems.✅ JEP 462 – Structured Concurrency (Second Preview) Improves thread lifecycle management and simplifies parallel processing. This is huge for backend services needing concurrency without chaos — perfect fit for services deployed via AWS Lambda, ECS, or EKS.🧱 How this strengthens Hexagonal Architecture and DDDJava 24’s cleaner syntax and enhanced language constructs allow for: 🔹 Richer domain modeling without ceremony 🔹 Easier testing and mocking of application ports 🔹 Clearer separation of concerns in inbound/outbound adapters 🔹 Better observability and tracing when paired with AWS services like CloudWatch & X-Ray☁️ AWS + Java 24 = Cloud-native powerCombined with AWS, Java 24 enables: ✅ Lighter Lambda functions (faster cold starts with JDK optimizations) ✅ Enhanced developer productivity with CodeWhisperer and Amazon Q Developer ✅ Seamless integration with infrastructure-as-code (CDK, Terraform) and microservices ecosystemsWe’re not just writing code — we’re building resilient, scalable ecosystems. Java 24 gives us sharper tools to do that smarter, faster, and cleaner.Are you already experimenting with Java 24? What’s your favorite improvement so far?hashtag#Java24 hashtag#HexagonalArchitecture hashtag#DDD hashtag#SoftwareArchitecture hashtag#AWS hashtag#CloudNative hashtag#Innovation hashtag#BackendEngineering hashtag#Leadership hashtag#LinkedInInsiderBR
