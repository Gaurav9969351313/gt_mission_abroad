OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger?

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency.

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

David ParkeDavid Parke,,We’re hiring! Come work on cool space stuff at Sphinx Defense.6 new positions for Fullstack/Backend/Devops Engineers.
OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

Sarah ThomasSarah Thomas,,"My Friday thought for today! “Hiring Indigenous talent isn’t just about being inclusive—it’s about empowering the future of work.""As an Indigenous woman, I’ve often felt the weight of walking into interviews wondering if I’d be seen, heard, or truly considered. When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

Sarah ThomasSarah Thomas,,"My Friday thought for today! “Hiring Indigenous talent isn’t just about being inclusive—it’s about empowering the future of work.""As an Indigenous woman, I’ve often felt the weight of walking into interviews wondering if I’d be seen, heard, or truly considered. When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

Sarah ThomasSarah Thomas,,"My Friday thought for today! “Hiring Indigenous talent isn’t just about being inclusive—it’s about empowering the future of work.""As an Indigenous woman, I’ve often felt the weight of walking into interviews wondering if I’d be seen, heard, or truly considered. When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

Sarah ThomasSarah Thomas,,"My Friday thought for today! “Hiring Indigenous talent isn’t just about being inclusive—it’s about empowering the future of work.""As an Indigenous woman, I’ve often felt the weight of walking into interviews wondering if I’d be seen, heard, or truly considered. When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

Sarah ThomasSarah Thomas,,"My Friday thought for today! “Hiring Indigenous talent isn’t just about being inclusive—it’s about empowering the future of work.""As an Indigenous woman, I’ve often felt the weight of walking into interviews wondering if I’d be seen, heard, or truly considered. When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

Sarah ThomasSarah Thomas,,"My Friday thought for today! “Hiring Indigenous talent isn’t just about being inclusive—it’s about empowering the future of work.""As an Indigenous woman, I’ve often felt the weight of walking into interviews wondering if I’d be seen, heard, or truly considered. When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help.

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.#onsite #hybrid #remote #jobs #devops #dotnet #sdet #qa #nodejs #react #fullstack #frontend #hadoop #qualityengineer #contract#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop #contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC #Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework #remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles #remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Sarah ThomasSarah Thomas,,"My Friday thought for today! “Hiring Indigenous talent isn’t just about being inclusive—it’s about empowering the future of work.""As an Indigenous woman, I’ve often felt the weight of walking into interviews wondering if I’d be seen, heard, or truly considered. When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters

OWEN AGBOJEOWEN AGBOJE,,"🚧 How I Overcame a Major Project Failure 🎤A few years ago, I was leading the deployment of a Node.js application to AWS Lightsail. Everything looked great on paper — the code was solid, the pipeline was configured, and the deadline was tight, but doable.Then came the failure.Right after deployment, the application didn't serve as expected. I could SSH into the server, the services were running, but users kept seeing a blank page. Logs showed no clear errors. We had to halt the rollout, and stakeholders were understandably frustrated.The problem? The app was starting from the wrong entry point — we had deployed index.ts, but our CI/CD pipeline defaulted to the wrong directory (/var/www/html). It was a classic case of “it worked on my machine” — and it cost us valuable time.💡 What I Learned:Never assume environment consistency. Document and test deployment directories explicitly.Automate sanity checks post-deployment (even a simple curl to the home page could’ve flagged this earlier).Own the failure, but focus on the fix. I worked late into the night with my team, rewrote the pipeline, and redeployed from the correct entry point.Most importantly, I learned to communicate transparently with stakeholders during a crisis.Today, our deployments are smoother, and I’ve grown more confident handling surprises in production.🗣️ Have you ever had a project crash and burn, only to bounce back stronger? Let’s talk — your comeback story might inspire someone today.hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CICD hashtag#FailureToSuccess hashtag#LessonsLearned hashtag#AWS hashtag#Lightsail hashtag#Nodejs hashtag#Reflection

Todd JonesTodd Jones,,"I’m now firmly in my third month of un(der)employment. It’s been an interesting one.👨🏼‍💻 Good News: I began working a FT job recently which is in a completely different world than where I came from, but in many ways not that different at all. It’s enough money to keep me off the state’s dime but just barely. It’s a shadow of my most recent salary and the first time I’ve had to actually punch a clock in (uuuugh) 30 years or more BUT it’s a job and in lieu of a world that seems more likely to cut off its nose to spite its face than do anything that makes sense at all, I’ll take it. This is something I should have done the last time I was out of work. Idle hands, and all that.🎉 It shortens the resume gap, and if any of my potential future employers are reading this hopefully they’ll see that I am willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. Even if that job is just making the grocery budget manageable.⛔️ DO NOT let your pride or ego get in your way. Take that random PT or FT gig while you’re still seeking your next main gig. Get out of the house. Enjoy the process. You never know what might happen.☑️ Worst case - it’s another hard reset and I make something cool out of this. I’ll add some new tools to my arsenal, meet some genuinely awesome people, and not be bored in the interim. Wouldn’t be the first time…🙏🏻 That’s how I got into live events, after all.🚨 This job is also being super considerate about letting me take short-term event contracts as they come along, too. It’s a win-win, really.🥺 A lot of people I know continue to get laid off/made redundant/get Trumped. I hate it. Good people. Smart people. I am pulling for you all to land as close to what you want or need as you can. I am trying to share as many of your hashtag#OpenToWork posts as possible to help. Reach back if your new gig has a head count. 😉

Alexandr PetrovAlexandr Petrov,,"Why I Have Declined a Fully-Remote $7,150 Net/Month Offer.Recently, I was actively job hunting and got pretty far with a promising opportunity. I completed the technical task, passed the interviews, and received an offer from a well-known international company with a strong media presence and a quite ethical business model.The position was for a DevOps engineer. The terms were excellent: official B2B contract, fully remote work - I could work from anywhere, even a small village back home in Kazakhstan. They offered a three-week paid company bootcamp in Cyprus and a long-term collaboration. Some of their employees had been with the company for over 12 years - it sounded like a dream job.I had already arranged an early exit from my current work, started looking for tickets to Cyprus, and was mentally ready to sign the contract.But when the actual contract arrived, although it was generally fine, one detail immediately caught my attention: there was no liability limitation clause.For employees under standard labor law in almost any country, it is usually not an issue because labor laws protect employees against unlimited financial liability. But for B2B or contractor agreements, things are different - unless explicitly stated otherwise, the contractor can be held fully liable.As someone with significant DevOps experience, I know firsthand that mistakes can be costly. It might only take a few hours to accidentally cause damages worth several months of my salary. While I’ve never had a serious incident myself, I understand that no one is immune to risk - it’s part of the job.So, I politely asked to add a simple clause: to cap the liability to a maximum of three months' salary.The HR representative immediately refused, saying, ""This is our standard contract. Everyone signs it, and so should you."" They told me they’ve never had any lawsuits and insisted there was no need to change anything. Moreover, I was repeatedly told that literally no one in the whole company, including legal, HR, and the hiring manager, understands my concern and I should just sign the contract as it is. The hiring manager allegedly is also under the same contract, has caused damages ranging into hundreds of thousands of USD before, and ""everything was fine.""I spent a lot of time carefully explaining my concern - that it’s not about mistrust but about basic risk management - but they stuck to their position. Eventually, they gave me an ultimatum: sign it as-is, or walk away.I chose to walk away.I've been in this industry long enough to know: mistakes will happen eventually, and when they do, they can be very expensive. Signing a contract with unlimited personal liability would be like playing Russian roulette with my financial future. In my opinion it just wasn't worth it.

Sarah ThomasSarah Thomas,,"My Friday thought for today! “Hiring Indigenous talent isn’t just about being inclusive—it’s about empowering the future of work.""As an Indigenous woman, I’ve often felt the weight of walking into interviews wondering if I’d be seen, heard, or truly considered. When I applied to Clear Seas I was nervous. I didn’t think I’d get the job—I didn’t tick every single box on the job posting.  But here I am 5 years later, loving and always learning in my role as Director of Indigenous Programs. Too often, Indigenous professionals are overlooked. Told we’re not “qualified” enough. Told we don’t quite “fit.” But here’s what I want to say to every employer out there: Indigenous people are more than survivors of colonization and residential schools—we are leaders.We bring with us generations of knowledge, a spirit of adaptability, and an openness to learning and growth. We are connectors. Listeners. Innovators. And when we apply for roles in your organization, we’re not just looking for a job—we’re offering *you* a chance to work *with us.*So, yes—hire Indigenous professionals. Not just because it’s good for reconciliation, or because it checks a box. Do it because we’re powerful. We’re forward-thinking. hashtag#IndigenousCareers hashtag#ReconciliationInAction hashtag#ICPP hashtag#OceanSector hashtag#IndigenousExcellence hashtag#ClearSeas hashtag#RepresentationMatters
