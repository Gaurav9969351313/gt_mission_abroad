Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

For over a decade now, I’ve been obsessed with helping my clients build winning job search strategies, network with confidence, and get plugged into the real working world. 🌍 I'll continue doing whatever it takes to help YOU unlock opportunities you don’t even see yet — because that’s my way of giving back. 💛hashtag#CareerCoaching hashtag#CareerMentoring hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#UKEducation hashtag#BritishCouncil hashtag#HR hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#PSW University of Liverpool Careers & Employability, University of Liverpool

"Christine Langlois CPA, CMAChristine Langlois CPA, CMA",,"💼 Staying Motivated During the Job Search JourneyJob searching as a Finance professional can feel like running a marathon without a finish line in sight. Some days bring exciting opportunities and great conversations. Other days? Silence.What keeps me motivated is remembering the value we bring.  💯 Finance isn't just about numbers,  It's about 👉 helping drive strategy.👉 Enabling growth.👉 Shaping the future of businesses.Every application, every interview, and every networking conversation is an investment, not just in landing the next role, but in becoming a stronger, more resilient version of myself.To all my fellow Finance professionals navigating the search:🌟 Stay focused on your goals.🌟 Celebrate small wins (even just sending that one application today).🌟 Keep sharpening your skills and growing your network.🌟 Believe in the expertise and impact you bring.The right opportunity will come, and when it does, you'll be ready.💥 If you're on a similar journey, I'd love to connect and encourage each other along the way! 🚀hashtag#FinanceCareers hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#FPandA hashtag#FinanceLeadership hashtag#Resilience hashtag#GrowthMindset

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Kaushik KumarKaushik Kumar,,"hashtag#RussellGroup and hashtag#UniversityofLiverpool hashtag#UOL did open doors I never knew existed ⤵️BTW my mum and I are taking a stroll after having a superb dinner at hashtag#TheTajMahalPalace Mumbai and before taking the flight to Nigeria.Close to 13 years ago, before kickstarting my huge L&D consulting assignment with hashtag#NigerianGovernment, I wanted to spend time with my mother and that evening was indeed memorable!Spending 4 years at hashtag#UniversityofLiverpool pursuing my undergraduate allowed me to experience the pinnacle of what the university had to offer in terms of its excellent academics, extracurriculars, continuous career support via hashtag#CareerServices, and the international community, which helped build my network around the world and connect with huge alum network which ultimately opened doors which I never knew existed.That’s why I always say — an education from a world-class UK university like hashtag#UniversityofLiverpool or any other hashtag#RussellGroup institution gives you potential, but it’s the right career guidance and strategy that truly turns potential into reality. 🎯 In today’s world, having a degree alone is not enough — knowing how to position yourself, build the right network, and navigate the hidden job market is absolutely mission-critical.And that’s exactly why I don’t just “create resumes.” A good resume is the starting line, not the finish line. For over a decade now, I’ve been obsessed with helping my clients build winning job search strategies, network with confidence, and get plugged into the real working world. 🌍 I'll continue doing whatever it takes to help YOU unlock opportunities you don’t even see yet — because that’s my way of giving back. 💛hashtag#CareerCoaching hashtag#CareerMentoring hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#UKEducation hashtag#BritishCouncil hashtag#HR hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#PSW University of Liverpool Careers & Employability, University of Liverpool

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

Badis ZormatiBadis Zormati,,"How to land a job in a FAANG company?Watching Rihab L. prepare for, and absolutely crush  interviews at places like Google and Microsoft has been one of the most inspiring things I've witnessed up close. It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

For over a decade now, I’ve been obsessed with helping my clients build winning job search strategies, network with confidence, and get plugged into the real working world. 🌍 I'll continue doing whatever it takes to help YOU unlock opportunities you don’t even see yet — because that’s my way of giving back. 💛hashtag#CareerCoaching hashtag#CareerMentoring hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#UKEducation hashtag#BritishCouncil hashtag#HR hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#PSW University of Liverpool Careers & Employability, University of Liverpool

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

AspiraXAspiraX,,"🌿 Weekend Thoughts: For Everyone Who’s Still Trying...As the weekend comes, some people rest. Some people celebrate. And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

For over a decade now, I’ve been obsessed with helping my clients build winning job search strategies, network with confidence, and get plugged into the real working world. 🌍 I'll continue doing whatever it takes to help YOU unlock opportunities you don’t even see yet — because that’s my way of giving back. 💛hashtag#CareerCoaching hashtag#CareerMentoring hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#UKEducation hashtag#BritishCouncil hashtag#HR hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#PSW University of Liverpool Careers & Employability, University of Liverpool

Some days bring exciting opportunities and great conversations. Other days? Silence.What keeps me motivated is remembering the value we bring.  💯 Finance isn't just about numbers,  It's about 👉 helping drive strategy.👉 Enabling growth.👉 Shaping the future of businesses.Every application, every interview, and every networking conversation is an investment, not just in landing the next role, but in becoming a stronger, more resilient version of myself.To all my fellow Finance professionals navigating the search:🌟 Stay focused on your goals.🌟 Celebrate small wins (even just sending that one application today).🌟 Keep sharpening your skills and growing your network.🌟 Believe in the expertise and impact you bring.The right opportunity will come, and when it does, you'll be ready.💥 If you're on a similar journey, I'd love to connect and encourage each other along the way! 🚀hashtag#FinanceCareers hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#FPandA hashtag#FinanceLeadership hashtag#Resilience hashtag#GrowthMindset

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

Badis ZormatiBadis Zormati,,"How to land a job in a FAANG company?Watching Rihab L. prepare for, and absolutely crush  interviews at places like Google and Microsoft has been one of the most inspiring things I've witnessed up close. It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Kaushik KumarKaushik Kumar,,"hashtag#RussellGroup and hashtag#UniversityofLiverpool hashtag#UOL did open doors I never knew existed ⤵️BTW my mum and I are taking a stroll after having a superb dinner at hashtag#TheTajMahalPalace Mumbai and before taking the flight to Nigeria.Close to 13 years ago, before kickstarting my huge L&D consulting assignment with hashtag#NigerianGovernment, I wanted to spend time with my mother and that evening was indeed memorable!Spending 4 years at hashtag#UniversityofLiverpool pursuing my undergraduate allowed me to experience the pinnacle of what the university had to offer in terms of its excellent academics, extracurriculars, continuous career support via hashtag#CareerServices, and the international community, which helped build my network around the world and connect with huge alum network which ultimately opened doors which I never knew existed.That’s why I always say — an education from a world-class UK university like hashtag#UniversityofLiverpool or any other hashtag#RussellGroup institution gives you potential, but it’s the right career guidance and strategy that truly turns potential into reality. 🎯 In today’s world, having a degree alone is not enough — knowing how to position yourself, build the right network, and navigate the hidden job market is absolutely mission-critical.And that’s exactly why I don’t just “create resumes.” A good resume is the starting line, not the finish line. For over a decade now, I’ve been obsessed with helping my clients build winning job search strategies, network with confidence, and get plugged into the real working world. 🌍 I'll continue doing whatever it takes to help YOU unlock opportunities you don’t even see yet — because that’s my way of giving back. 💛hashtag#CareerCoaching hashtag#CareerMentoring hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#UKEducation hashtag#BritishCouncil hashtag#HR hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#PSW University of Liverpool Careers & Employability, University of Liverpool

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

AspiraXAspiraX,,"🌿 Weekend Thoughts: For Everyone Who’s Still Trying...As the weekend comes, some people rest. Some people celebrate. And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.

Lukas LevinLukas Levin,,"My “Job Interview” series is officially award-winning! I’ve been so busy that I haven’t been able to share that a couple weeks ago I was awarded an Eric Sevareid Award of Merit for one of the first “Job Interviews” I produced. When I first came up with the idea for the series, I had a very loose idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted to talk to everyday Minnesotans and explore avenues rarely talked about. With the help of Heidi Raschke and Megan Burks, we were able to come up with something simple: Take a news peg from the month, find someone whose work is indirectly/directly related to it, and get them on air. From scoreboard operators, hemp growers and election-ballot designers, I’ve found some really interesting fields and met some really cool Minnesotans.You can listen to the award-winning interview here:https://lnkd.in/dNZSwtui

And some… are just trying to breathe.If you're job searching, benching, waiting for that one call — I know weekends feel different. They aren't just a break from work. They're a reminder that you're still waiting. Still hoping. Still fighting a silent battle nobody else sees.Behind every resume, every LinkedIn post, every application — there’s a real human heart carrying dreams bigger than words.So this weekend, I just want to say:🌱 You are allowed to rest. 🌱 You are allowed to feel tired. 🌱 You are allowed to feel everything — and still believe.hashtag#onsite hashtag#hybrid hashtag#remote hashtag#jobs hashtag#devops hashtag#dotnet hashtag#sdet hashtag#qa hashtag#nodejs hashtag#react hashtag#fullstack hashtag#frontend hashtag#hadoop hashtag#qualityengineer hashtag#contracthashtag#job hashtag#jobopening hashtag#openings hashtag#hiring hashtag#hiringimmediately hashtag#hotlist hashtag#sales hashtag#benchsales hashtag#benchsalesrecruiter hashtag#benchsalesrecruiters hashtag#benchsale hashtag#vendorlist hashtag#vendors hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#vendor hashtag#recruitment hashtag#recruiters hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#corp2corp hashtag#updating hashtag#requirements hashtag#requirement hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#list hashtag#post hashtag#comment hashtag#distribution hashtag#sales hashtag#email hashtag#recruitment hashtag#linkedin hashtag#recuriting hashtag#salesrecruiters hashtag#salesrecruiter hashtag#salesrecruitment hashtag#salesrecruiting hashtag#hotlist hashtag#hotlists hashtag#hotlisting hashtag#hiringhashtag#preferred hashtag#dailyrequirements hashtag#urgentrequirement hashtag#urgenthiring hashtag#opt hashtag#usc hashtag#h1b hashtag#usitrecruitment hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usbenchsales hashtag#opportunityhashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2only hashtag#crop2crop hashtag#c2c hashtag#c2crecruiters hashtag#c2cconsultant hashtag#c2crequirements hashtag#c2cconsultants hashtag#c2cconsultats hashtag#c2cjobs hashtag#c2cvendors hashtag#c2creqs hashtag#c2chiring hashtag#c2chotlist hashtag#c2crequirement hashtag#c2cvendorlist hashtag#c2cvendores hashtag#c2cvendor hashtag#c2cavailable hashtag#c2croles hashtag#c2cusajobs hashtag#croptocrop hashtag#contract hashtag#vendorslist hashtag#usitrecruiting hashtag#usitrecruiters hashtag#usitbenchsales hashtag#usitjobs hashtag#usitrecruiter hashtag#usitstaffing hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#uscitizenship hashtag#usajobs hashtag#greencard hashtag#gcead hashtag#GC hashtag#w2job hashtag#w2contract hashtag#w2 hashtag#w2requirement hashtag#w2only hashtag#w2jobs hashtag#w2requirements hashtag#w2contract hashtag#hexaware hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedin hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedinjobs hashtag#uscitizen hashtag#usc hashtag#greencard hashtag#GC hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remotework hashtag#remote hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#remotejob hashtag#remoterole hashtag#remoteopportunties hashtag#remoteroles hashtag#remote hashtag#linkedinposts hashtag#linkedinfamily hashtag#linkedinconnections hashtag#linkedinpost hashtag#linkedinconnection hashtag#linkedin

Suvera ChandanalaSuvera Chandanala,,"The ""Unfortunately"" phase!The moment I see ""Unfortunately..."" at the start of an email, I don't even need to read the rest. We all know what follows.As an international student navigating the job market, rejection has become a familiar companion. Some days, I find myself sorting through emails looking only for that one word - ""unfortunately"" - before moving on to the next message, preserving my mental energy for battles I can win.But here's what I've learned through hundreds of applications and countless rejections:Every ""no"" is redirecting you to where you belong. Every closed door is guiding you somewhere else. The right opportunity doesn't just need your skills - it needs YOU, with your unique global perspective and cross-cultural insights.The job search feels especially isolating when you're thousands of miles from home, but remember - there's an entire community of internationals walking this same path. Reach out, share stories, offer support.The right opportunity is coming. The right employer will see your international background as the asset it truly is.Keep networking relentlessly. Yes, they say it's easy for locals, but for us internationals... well, we know it's a different game entirely. Every connection counts. Every conversation could open doors that applications alone cannot.Don't lose hope. We've come too far to give up now. Remember all the barriers you've already overcome just to study or work abroad - the visa processes, the cultural adjustments, the distance from family. If you made it through all that, you'll make it through this job search too.Stay strong. Keep applying. This is just a phase, not your permanent reality. We will do this. 🙌 hashtag#InternationalStudents hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#CareerJourney hashtag#StayResilient hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#InternationalNetworking

It wasn’t just about talent (though she has plenty of that), it was about how intentionally she approached every step: from finding the right referrals, to mastering the “Champion Call,” to staying relentlessly prepared.Her journey taught me something powerful: breaking into FAANG isn’t magic. It’s strategy, resilience, and having the right playbook.💬 The tips Rihab shared with me, the behind-the-scenes moves most people don’t even know about completely changed the way I look at big tech hiring.And now, she’s sharing that same playbook with all of you. 🚀We just made it available inside our new Mystery Box, tucked away in your profile once you sign up.If you’re dreaming of a role at Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, or any top tech company, this could be your secret weapon.I couldn’t be prouder to share this with you all.
