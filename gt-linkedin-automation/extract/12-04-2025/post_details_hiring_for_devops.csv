Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well.

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn.

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project?

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn.

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies.

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.

vipul kumarvipul kumar,,"🌪 6 Months Ago, I Was Rejected... Today, I’m Still Unplaced – But Much Stronger.In mid-September, after my rejection from TCS Prime, I was demotivated. I didn’t know what to do next, but I was clear on one thing — I wanted to work in tech.To create more opportunities, I joined Harkirat Singh’s Web Dev Cohort 3. Though I joined late, I pushed hard to catch up.✅ In October-November:Learned React, Hooks, Recoil, Tailwind CSSBackend: Node.js, Express.js, Zod, bcryptDatabase: MongoDBThen I started building real-world projects:🧠 Brainly – Digital knowledge manager 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gXGxSyMa🎬 Netflix Clone 📌 Live: https://lnkd.in/geHZNcAQI applied to many companies. Rejections continued, but I kept learning.One of the turning points came when I got an assessment from Urban Culture for a backend role. I had to build a REST API and integrate Firebase (which I hadn’t used before). Still, I cleared the assessment. 📌 GitHub: https://lnkd.in/g3_Rb7UuInterview didn’t go well, but I learned a lot.Then a friend suggested:""Keep your GitHub active. Make consistent, meaningful commits.""Since then: ✅ Over 500 commits in last 3 months ✅ Reached out to recruiters, asked for referralsIn Feb, I moved to Delhi and joined AccioJob’s hiring platform – which conducts tests for hiring companies. If you perform well, your resume gets shortlisted.Out of 7–8 tests, I cleared 3–4. But some interviews didn’t go well. I realized I needed to work on DSA and bit manipulation.So I started solving: 📌 Striver SDE Sheet (120+ questions) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gNXFPyqdAlso revised core concepts: 📌 JavaScript​: Promises, Arrays, Events GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gAFv6wJh 📌 React + Redux GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gygsem5xNew Projects: 🆕 Product Compare App (KYC Hub) GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gpntYqm8 🆕 Next.js Assessment (Astra Security) Live: https://lnkd.in/g9yQhzBp🔥 What I’ve Learned:I may not have everything, but I have dedication, consistency, and willingness to learn. I believe if I get a chance, I’ll give my best and even beyond that.🎯 My Next Goals:Work on more real-world projectsStrengthen communication skillsLearn PostgreSQL, Next.jsFinish Striver Sheet, then move to CodeforcesLearn DevOps (via Harkirat Singh)If you're hiring or can refer me for a Full Stack / MERN / SDE role — I’d love to connect 🤝 Let’s grow together 🚀

Mozahid HusainMozahid Husain,,"Zero Downtime Deployment means updating your application without any interruption to the end users. This is crucial for production systems, especially in high-availability environments.Here are popular zero downtime deployment strategies, along with how they work and their pros/cons:⸻1. Blue-Green DeploymentHow it works: •	You have two identical environments: Blue (live) and Green (staging). •	Deploy the new version to Green. •	Run tests and verify. •	Switch traffic from Blue to Green (usually via a load balancer). •	Rollback = just switch back to Blue.Pros: •	Quick rollback •	Safe testing in production-like environmentCons: •	Double infrastructure cost⸻2. Canary DeploymentHow it works: •	Gradually release the new version to a small subset of users. •	Monitor metrics, logs, errors. •	Slowly increase rollout percentage until 100%.Pros: •	Controlled, low-risk release •	Easy to detect issues earlyCons: •	More complex traffic management •	Requires observability⸻3. Rolling UpdateHow it works: •	Update servers or containers one at a time (or in batches). •	Each instance is replaced while keeping the service available.Pros: •	No extra infra needed •	Simple in KubernetesCons: •	Slower update process •	Harder rollback if something breaks midway⸻4. Feature Toggles (Flags)How it works: •	Deploy new code with features hidden behind toggles. •	Gradually enable features for users after deployment.Pros: •	Safe experimentation •	Instant rollback without redeploymentCons: •	More logic in the codebase •	Requires toggle management⸻5. Shadow DeploymentHow it works: •	New version runs in parallel to the current one but does not serve real traffic. •	It processes a copy of live traffic for validation.Pros: •	Risk-free testing with real data •	No user impactCons: •	Extra infra & traffic duplication⸻Bonus Tools That Support Zero Downtime: •	Kubernetes (for rolling updates, readiness probes) •	Spinnaker, ArgoCD, or Flagger (for canary & progressive delivery) •	Istio or NGINX (for traffic splitting)hashtag#DevOps hashtag#DevOpsEngineer hashtag#DevOpsCommunity hashtag#CI_CD hashtag#Automationhashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Dockerhashtag#InfrastructureAsCode hashtag#CloudEngineerhashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerInTech hashtag#TechInterviews hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechCareers

LakshmiNarayana SenagavarapuLakshmiNarayana Senagavarapu,,"🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: 1- Pet Shop Application with HTML! 🚀I recently had the opportunity to deploy a Pet Shop application with HTML, hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and I used a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, Docker, and Kubernetes to make it all come together seamlessly.Here are a few cool things I worked on:Jenkins: I explored advanced features like role-based access, agent setup, managing plugins and credentials, and wrote some Groovy scripts for smooth automation. I also got hands-on with Jenkins shared libraries, which enhanced my ability to manage reusable code across pipelines.Docker: The app is fully containerized using Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale.AWS: Managed the infrastructure using EC2, IAM, and Security Groups to ensure everything was both secure and scalable.The best part of this project? I had the chance to learn a lot of these concepts from TheGreatcoder lectures, which helped me understand the inner workings of Jenkins, Docker,  Kubernetes and AWS in a hands-on way.If you're interested in how I built this or want to check out the code, feel free to explore the full project on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/gQPwTXfvA big thanks to Vamsibyramala for his amazing teaching – couldn't have done it without his guidance!I’d love to hear your thoughts, so feel free to drop a comment or connect if you’ve worked with similar tools!hashtag#AWS hashtag#Azure hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#Terraform hashtag#Ansible hashtag#CI/CD hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Automationhashtag#immediatejoiner hashtag#connections hashtag#hiringalert hashtag#itrecruiter hashtag#hiring hashtag#teamlead hashtag#humanresource

Marfa OverseasMarfa Overseas,,"Future-Proofing with RPO: Addressing the Tech Talent ShortageIn today’s fast-paced digital economy, technology has become the backbone of innovation and business transformation. But as organizations lean into AI, automation, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity, one critical roadblock stands in the way: the tech talent shortage.It’s not just a hiring challenge—it’s a business risk.The Tech Talent CrunchDespite an abundance of opportunities, companies across industries are struggling to fill roles in software development, data science, DevOps, and cybersecurity. According to industry reports, millions of tech roles are projected to remain unfilled globally in the coming years. The competition for skilled professionals is fierce, timelines are tight, and traditional hiring methods often fall short.So how do companies scale quickly and strategically in this climate?Enter RPO: Recruitment Process OutsourcingRecruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) offers a future-proof strategy to bridge the gap. More than just an external hiring partner, an RPO provider becomes an extension of your talent acquisition team—bringing in specialized expertise, scalable resources, and deep market insight.Key Advantages of RPO in Tackling Tech Hiring Challenges:✅ Scalability – Need to hire 50 developers in six months? Or scale back after a product pivot? RPO gives you the flexibility to ramp hiring up or down without compromising quality.✅ Speed & Efficiency – RPO providers leverage advanced recruitment technologies, pre-vetted pipelines, and data-driven processes to significantly reduce time-to-fill.✅ Access to Niche Talent – RPO teams often have deeper access to passive candidates and hard-to-reach tech talent through curated talent pools and targeted sourcing strategies.✅ Global Reach – With tech roles increasingly going remote or hybrid, global talent acquisition is critical. RPO partners can navigate cross-border hiring seamlessly.✅ Employer Branding – In a candidate-driven market, how you show up matters. RPO providers can help refine and amplify your EVP (Employee Value Proposition) to attract top tech talent.RPO: A Long-Term Strategy, Not a StopgapWhile some organizations turn to RPO for short-term hiring surges, the most forward-thinking companies integrate RPO into their long-term talent strategy. It’s not just about filling seats—it’s about building resilient, future-ready teams that can adapt to ongoing tech evolution.Final ThoughtsThe tech talent shortage isn’t going away anytime soon—but with the right strategies in place, your business doesn’t have to fall behind. Partnering with an RPO provider is a proactive way to secure the skills you need today, while building a flexible, scalable foundation for tomorrow.Ready to future-proof your workforce? RPO might just be your smartest next move.
