Shoaib RehmanShoaib Rehman,,"Want to crack your QA/SDET interviews with confidence? Here’s your secret weapon.I’ve compiled 50+ Java programs that are frequently asked in QA/SDET interviews — ranging from simple logic like Palindrome, Prime numbers, and Fibonacci series to string manipulations, array tricks, and even `equals()` & `hashCode()` implementations.Whether you’re:- A QA transitioning into automation- A Fresher aiming for an SDET role- Or just someone brushing up on core JavaThis document is a goldmine!Some highlights:- Reverse a string without using inbuilt methods - Find duplicate characters using HashMap - Swap two numbers/strings without a third variable - Identify non-repeating elements in arrays - Get clean outputs like `a2b2c3d2` from `""aabbcccdd""`Here’s the best part:No fluff, just pure logic-based programs with expected outputs — perfect for quick revision before interviews.Want a copy? **Drop a ""Java"" in the comments or DM me!** I’ll send it over.Let’s help more people prepare smartly.

Here’s your secret weapon.I’ve compiled 50+ Java programs that are frequently asked in QA/SDET interviews — ranging from simple logic like Palindrome, Prime numbers, and Fibonacci series to string manipulations, array tricks, and even `equals()` & `hashCode()` implementations.Whether you’re:- A QA transitioning into automation- A Fresher aiming for an SDET role- Or just someone brushing up on core JavaThis document is a goldmine!Some highlights:- Reverse a string without using inbuilt methods - Find duplicate characters using HashMap - Swap two numbers/strings without a third variable - Identify non-repeating elements in arrays - Get clean outputs like `a2b2c3d2` from `""aabbcccdd""`Here’s the best part:No fluff, just pure logic-based programs with expected outputs — perfect for quick revision before interviews.Want a copy? **Drop a ""Java"" in the comments or DM me!** I’ll send it over.Let’s help more people prepare smartly.

Shoaib RehmanShoaib Rehman,,"Want to crack your QA/SDET interviews with confidence? Here’s your secret weapon.I’ve compiled 50+ Java programs that are frequently asked in QA/SDET interviews — ranging from simple logic like Palindrome, Prime numbers, and Fibonacci series to string manipulations, array tricks, and even `equals()` & `hashCode()` implementations.Whether you’re:- A QA transitioning into automation- A Fresher aiming for an SDET role- Or just someone brushing up on core JavaThis document is a goldmine!Some highlights:- Reverse a string without using inbuilt methods - Find duplicate characters using HashMap - Swap two numbers/strings without a third variable - Identify non-repeating elements in arrays - Get clean outputs like `a2b2c3d2` from `""aabbcccdd""`Here’s the best part:No fluff, just pure logic-based programs with expected outputs — perfect for quick revision before interviews.Want a copy? **Drop a ""Java"" in the comments or DM me!** I’ll send it over.Let’s help more people prepare smartly.

Here’s your secret weapon.I’ve compiled 50+ Java programs that are frequently asked in QA/SDET interviews — ranging from simple logic like Palindrome, Prime numbers, and Fibonacci series to string manipulations, array tricks, and even `equals()` & `hashCode()` implementations.Whether you’re:- A QA transitioning into automation- A Fresher aiming for an SDET role- Or just someone brushing up on core JavaThis document is a goldmine!Some highlights:- Reverse a string without using inbuilt methods - Find duplicate characters using HashMap - Swap two numbers/strings without a third variable - Identify non-repeating elements in arrays - Get clean outputs like `a2b2c3d2` from `""aabbcccdd""`Here’s the best part:No fluff, just pure logic-based programs with expected outputs — perfect for quick revision before interviews.Want a copy? **Drop a ""Java"" in the comments or DM me!** I’ll send it over.Let’s help more people prepare smartly.

Shoaib RehmanShoaib Rehman,,"Want to crack your QA/SDET interviews with confidence? Here’s your secret weapon.I’ve compiled 50+ Java programs that are frequently asked in QA/SDET interviews — ranging from simple logic like Palindrome, Prime numbers, and Fibonacci series to string manipulations, array tricks, and even `equals()` & `hashCode()` implementations.Whether you’re:- A QA transitioning into automation- A Fresher aiming for an SDET role- Or just someone brushing up on core JavaThis document is a goldmine!Some highlights:- Reverse a string without using inbuilt methods - Find duplicate characters using HashMap - Swap two numbers/strings without a third variable - Identify non-repeating elements in arrays - Get clean outputs like `a2b2c3d2` from `""aabbcccdd""`Here’s the best part:No fluff, just pure logic-based programs with expected outputs — perfect for quick revision before interviews.Want a copy? **Drop a ""Java"" in the comments or DM me!** I’ll send it over.Let’s help more people prepare smartly.
