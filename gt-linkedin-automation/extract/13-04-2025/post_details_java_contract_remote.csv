Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents?

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents?

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol

Buhake SindiBuhake Sindi,,"Google has introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This protocol¬†defines how autonomous agents can discover and communicate with one another in a consistent, secured, and structured way. Agents make themselves discoverable by exposing a public card via HTTP. A2A is an open protocol that complements Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides helpful tools and context to agents.What does this mean in your business?You can build AI agents for your specific department head, let it be discoverable among each other and automate your business rules and processes that your AI agents can implement, automatically. You can also add human-in-the-loop rule, meaning that when there needs a human intervention the AI agent will wait for human interaction to complete in order to it to resume its AI flow.Who are using A2A protocol? More than 50 technology partners are contributing and supporting A2A protocol. Google partners such as Atlassian, Box, Cohere, Intuit, LangChain, MongoDB, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, UKG and Workday; and leading service providers including Accenture, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Capgemini, Cognizant, Deloitte, HCLTech, Infosys, KPMG, McKinsey & Company, PwC, Tata Consultancy Services, and Wipro.Can you imagine, a fully fledged bank, running its entire operations (i.e., loans origination business) completely using AI agents? The future of fully autonomous AI is already here.For more information on how A2A works, you can read Google's official announcement here: https://lnkd.in/dnHY4vmsWhat are your thoughts?hashtag#AI hashtag#A2A hashtag#Agent2Agent hashtag#MCP hashtag#ModelContextProtocol
