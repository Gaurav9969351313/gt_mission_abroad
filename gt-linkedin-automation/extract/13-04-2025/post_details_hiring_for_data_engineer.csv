Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Rajkumar KhushalraoRajkumar Khushalrao,,"Schedule ControlAccording to the Project Management Institute (PMI), 35% of projects fail due to poor scheduling and timeline control. Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Rajkumar KhushalraoRajkumar Khushalrao,,"Schedule ControlAccording to the Project Management Institute (PMI), 35% of projects fail due to poor scheduling and timeline control. Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Rajkumar KhushalraoRajkumar Khushalrao,,"Schedule ControlAccording to the Project Management Institute (PMI), 35% of projects fail due to poor scheduling and timeline control. Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Rajkumar KhushalraoRajkumar Khushalrao,,"Schedule ControlAccording to the Project Management Institute (PMI), 35% of projects fail due to poor scheduling and timeline control. Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Azure FreelancerAzure Freelancer,,"From Azure Operations to Cloud Engineering – A Modern Career Evolution.In today’s rapidly evolving cloud ecosystem, the journey from being a Cloud Operations Engineer (L3 Azure Admin) to becoming a Cloud Engineering Lead with a strong DevOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) focus is not just natural—it's essential.This resume showcases exactly that transformation.Starting with deep technical hands-on experience in Azure Infrastructure—managing IaaS, PaaS, networking, security, backups, DR, patching, and monitoring—the individual played a critical role in maintaining stable and secure cloud environments. Responsibilities included working closely with leadership and customers, driving server and data migrations (via Azure Migrate & Azure Data Box), implementing change management (ITIL), automating repetitive tasks, and preparing detailed SLA & KPI reports.🚀 As the cloud matured, so did the career path—transitioning into a Cloud Engineering Lead role that brings in a strategic, engineering-driven mindset. The focus shifted to Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep), DevOps tooling (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions), cloud governance (RBAC, Azure Policy, Blueprints), and automation-first thinking. Now leading architecture decisions, building IaC frameworks, collaborating across teams, and guiding cloud transformations at scale.This resume represents what hiring managers want: a hands-on leader who not only knows how to operate the cloud but can engineer, automate, and innovate it to meet future demands.✅ Ideal for roles such as:Azure Cloud EngineerCloud Operations LeadAzure DevOps EngineerInfrastructure ArchitectSite Reliability Engineer (SRE)https://lnkd.in/gxhzXres

Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Yet, schedule control is still treated by many as a technical formality rather than a strategic shield.Here’s the truth:If you don’t control your schedule, it will control your cost, your contracts, and your credibility.The strongest project control systems: •	Use real-time data from tools like Primavera P6 to track and forecast progress •	Integrate schedule with cost and risk in unified dashboards •	Empower planners to challenge baselines, not just defend themControl the time — or the time controls everything else.hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#ScheduleControl hashtag#Primavera hashtag#GigaProjects hashtag#Leadership hashtag#IntegratedPlanning hashtag#PMP hashtag#CCPhashtag#MiningJobs hashtag#ProjectPlanner hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#MiningCareers hashtag#PerthJobs hashtag#WAJobs hashtag#SchedulerJobs hashtag#PlanningEngineer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#MajorProjects hashtag#MiningIndustry hashtag#FIFOJobs hashtag#CapitalProjects hashtag#ConstructionJobs hashtag#HiringNow hashtag#MiningRecruitment hashtag#ProjectScheduling hashtag#ResourceSector hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#TechnicalRecruitment hashtag#MiningOpportunities hashtag#EngineeringJobs hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#MiningRecruiter hashtag#InfrastructureProjects hashtag#SchedulingTools hashtag#PrimaveraP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer hashtag#ProjectManagement hashtag#ProjectControls hashtag#EarnedValueManagement hashtag#ResourceManagement hashtag#Scheduling hashtag#Analysis hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#Visualization hashtag#Dashboards hashtag#Reports hashtag#DataExport hashtag#Integration hashtag#Automation hashtag#UserInterface hashtag#Improvements hashtag#ProjectSchedulers hashtag#ProjectManagers hashtag#ProjectControllers hashtag#ConstructionManagement hashtag#EngineeringManagement hashtag#ProjectPlanning hashtag#LearnMore hashtag#DownloadNow hashtag#FreeTrial hashtag#Subscribe hashtag#PlanningP6Channel hashtag#ProjectSuccess hashtag#P6Tips hashtag#ProjectOptimization hashtag#ScheduleHealth hashtag#RiskMitigation hashtag#DecisionMaking hashtag#ProjectPerformance hashtag#BestPractices hashtag#PlanningP6 hashtag#ScheduleAnalyzer2024 hashtag#innovationhashtag#managementhashtag#digitalmarketinghashtag#technologyhashtag#creativityhashtag#futurismhashtag#startupshashtag#marketinghashtag#socialmediahashtag#socialnetworkinghashtag#motivationhashtag#personaldevelopmenthashtag#jobinterviewshashtag#sustainabilityhashtag#personalbrandinghashtag#educationhashtag#productivityhashtag#travelhashtag#saleshashtag#socialentrepreneurshiphashtag#fundraisinghashtag#lawhashtag#strategyhashtag#culturehashtag#fashionhashtag#businesshashtag#networkinghashtag#hiringhashtag#healthhashtag#inspiration hashtag#OilAndGas hashtag#EnergySector hashtag#GlobalMarkets hashtag#CrudeOil hashtag#BusinessInsights hashtag#OilProduction hashtag#PetroleumEngineering hashtag#FelixOdia hashtag#FutureTrends hashtag#Business hashtag#Structural hashtag#Offshore hashtag#Upstream hashtag#Design hashtag#FEED hashtag#Oil hashtag#Gas hashtag#FPSO hashtag#EPC hashtag#EPCI hashtag#EPCIC hashtag#OffshorePlatform hashtag#Malaysia hashtag#Aramco hashtag#ADNOC hashtag#QatarEnergy hashtag#NOC hashtag#NDT hashtag#ASME hashtag#API hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#PressureVessels hashtag#PipingInspection hashtag#Valves hashtag#Pipelines hashtag#MechanicalEngineering hashtag#InspectionStandards hashtag#oilandgashashtag#hiring hashtag#hirehashtag#recruitmenthashtag#middleeastjobshashtag#projecthashtag#projectshashtag#engineerhashtag#localhiringhashtag#omanjobshashtag#middleeasthashtag#engineeringhashtag#jobshashtag#localhashtag#muscathashtag#oman

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Manish V.Manish V.,,"""Teaching AI morality is not an engineering problem. It’s a human one.""In the world of AI, we often marvel at the technical prowess behind complex algorithms and powerful data processing capabilities. Yet, when it comes to embedding morality into AI systems, we face a challenge that transcends technical skill.At its core, morality involves values, ethics, and cultural nuances - elements that are inherently human. While engineers can program systems to follow specific rules, the essence of morality requires a deeper understanding of human values. This means that as business leaders looking to implement AI, we need to engage philosophers, ethicists, and diverse stakeholders in the conversation.Consider the impact AI can have in areas like customer service, hiring, or content moderation. Decisions made by AI in these contexts can significantly affect individuals' lives. Thus, incorporating moral considerations into AI systems is not merely about reducing bias or avoiding harm. It's about ensuring AI aligns with broader societal values and norms.To effectively teach AI morality, businesses must foster multidisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together diverse perspectives, businesses can develop AI that not only performs tasks efficiently but also does so ethically.Moreover, companies should prioritize transparency. Openly sharing how AI systems make decisions and involve ethical considerations will build trust with consumers. This transparency is key to maintaining a positive relationship with those who interact with your AI solutions.In conclusion, while AI engineers play a crucial role in developing systems, it is a collective responsibility to ensure these systems act morally. As we continue to integrate AI into our businesses, let's focus on creating solutions that reflect our shared values and ethical standards.P.S. How do you think companies can better integrate ethical considerations into their AI systems?Made it this far to read? Awesome! But if the post didn’t help or teach you anything, check out the video below. It may be a bit unrelated, but you might still learn something, or at the very least, be entertained (hopefully).  ******* Want to learn how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve your business operations?

Azure FreelancerAzure Freelancer,,"From Azure Operations to Cloud Engineering – A Modern Career Evolution.In today’s rapidly evolving cloud ecosystem, the journey from being a Cloud Operations Engineer (L3 Azure Admin) to becoming a Cloud Engineering Lead with a strong DevOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) focus is not just natural—it's essential.This resume showcases exactly that transformation.Starting with deep technical hands-on experience in Azure Infrastructure—managing IaaS, PaaS, networking, security, backups, DR, patching, and monitoring—the individual played a critical role in maintaining stable and secure cloud environments. Responsibilities included working closely with leadership and customers, driving server and data migrations (via Azure Migrate & Azure Data Box), implementing change management (ITIL), automating repetitive tasks, and preparing detailed SLA & KPI reports.🚀 As the cloud matured, so did the career path—transitioning into a Cloud Engineering Lead role that brings in a strategic, engineering-driven mindset. The focus shifted to Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep), DevOps tooling (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions), cloud governance (RBAC, Azure Policy, Blueprints), and automation-first thinking. Now leading architecture decisions, building IaC frameworks, collaborating across teams, and guiding cloud transformations at scale.This resume represents what hiring managers want: a hands-on leader who not only knows how to operate the cloud but can engineer, automate, and innovate it to meet future demands.✅ Ideal for roles such as:Azure Cloud EngineerCloud Operations LeadAzure DevOps EngineerInfrastructure ArchitectSite Reliability Engineer (SRE)https://lnkd.in/gxhzXres

Grant NivenGrant Niven,,"No Digital infrastructure is becoming even more critical in the race for Middle East leadership in the  AI & Digital Domain.As we all have a chuckle and share AI generated images of ourselves across social networks (and I’m as guilty as the rest of you 😬 ), there is a more serious impact looming with the growing consumption of Data!   The viral effect of AI use is just one example of the consumption pressure hitting the Global & in particular Middle East regions Datacentres, plus Networks & Energy providers.     There is glaring need to build out further capacity, especially in EDGE DC sector which brings compute power closer to users (the Wi-Fi boosters of the DC world). This recent Data Center Map (March 2025) shows the investment made to date across the Middle East (252 sites in totality…..55 of which are in Israel alone), but with ambitions of the region to be an AI powerhouse there is sky rocketing demand from business, govt and end consumers for more capacity.     It’s a good time to be in the Data Centre & Digital Infrastructure business!    In the the California gold rush (1848-55),  ⛏️ and shovels demand was outstripping supply….here we are again, but with GPU’s, efficient power generators and cooling systems 🤔.Mingzulu are all over this growth push, advising & securing investment in the sector in partnerhsip with tier 1 providers scaling out in the Middle East. If you are an hashtag#investor in Digital Infrastructure looking for fresh perspective in the hashtag#datacentres, hashtag#AI & hashtag#cloud domains in the hashtag#middleeast do reach out, happy to give you our point of view.

Nishtha KukretiNishtha Kukreti,,"🔍 𝗗𝗲𝗺𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗳𝘆𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻 𝗜𝗗𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗕𝗘𝗥𝗧: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗯𝗼𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗡𝗟𝗣 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹𝘀In the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model has drastically changed how machines process and understand human language. But one of the lesser-known yet essential elements that make BERT so effective is **𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐈𝐃𝐬**. 🤖💬So, what are **𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐈𝐃𝐬**., and why are they so crucial for BERT? 🤔What Are Token IDs?Token IDs are 𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞𝐬 that represent text after tokenization. BERT uses the 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐏𝐢𝐞𝐜𝐞 𝐭𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐫, breaking down words into subwords or even characters if needed. This helps BERT handle unseen or rare words (Out-Of-Vocabulary/OOV words) by splitting them into familiar subword units. For instance, ""̲𝐮̲𝐧̲𝐡̲𝐚̲𝐩̲𝐩̲𝐢̲𝐧̲𝐞̲𝐬̲𝐬̲""̲ might be split into:- ""𝐮𝐧""- ""𝐡𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬""Each of these parts gets a **𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐈𝐃** for efficient processing. 🎯Key Steps in Token ID Assignment:1. 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠: Text is tokenized using WordPiece, with special tokens like [𝐂𝐋𝐒] for the start of sentences.2. 𝐕𝐨𝐜𝐚𝐛𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐢𝐧𝐠: Tokenized words/subwords are mapped to unique IDs from BERT's 30K+ vocabulary.3. 𝐄𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠: The Token IDs are then passed through the model's layers to generate 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 using self-attention mechanisms.Why Does It Matter?- 𝐄𝐟𝐟𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲: Token IDs allow machines to process large text data efficiently.- 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥 𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠: They help BERT understand the relationships between words in a given context.- 𝐎𝐎𝐕 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠: Tokenizers ensure rare words are effectively represented through subword tokens.For engineers and data scientists, understanding **𝐓𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧 𝐈𝐃𝐬** is crucial for optimizing the model’s performance, especially when working with specialized or fine-tuned tasks. Whether it’s **𝐧𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐝 𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐠𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧** or **𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠**, the process of assigning token IDs underpins BERT’s ability to transform raw text into actionable insights. 💡🔑 Key Takeaways:- Token IDs are integers representing text after tokenization.- WordPiece tokenizer handles rare words by breaking them into subwords.- Consistent tokenization and special token management are key to optimizing BERT’s performance.🚀 On a personal note: I am currently serving my notice period and actively exploring new opportunities in 𝑴𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒆 𝑳𝒆𝒂𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈, 𝑮𝒆𝒏𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝑨𝑰, 𝑵𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒂𝒍 𝑳𝒂𝒏𝒈𝒖𝒂𝒈𝒆 𝑷𝒓𝒐𝒄𝒆𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈, and 𝒞𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒖𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝑽𝒊𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏.
