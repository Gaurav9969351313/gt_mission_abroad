Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Gokula Chandra KulalaGokula Chandra Kulala,,"🔁 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽: 𝗔 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗲𝗲𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗥𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲 For eight months, my job search has felt like a recursion loop with no clear base case – a cycle of applications met with visa sponsorship rejections. I understand the constraints, but I'm determined to find the company/ organization that recognizes talent beyond the initial conditions. I'm also conscious that this loop, without resolution, risks a ""stack overflow"" - not just for me, but for many talented individuals facing similar challenges.Consider me a well-optimized algorithm ready to execute across multiple data domains:* 𝗡𝗟𝗣 & 𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁: Designing and deploying intelligent systems that learn and adapt.* 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿: Deploying and optimizing scalable(CI/CD) solutions across cloud environments(Azure, AWS).* 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Transforming raw data into actionable insights and compelling narratives.* 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵: Always refining my skills and approaching problem solving with a growth mindset.I'm seeking a role as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Analyst where my technical skills and problem-solving abilities can create significant impact. I believe a brief conversation can provide the base case needed to break this recursion loop and demonstrate the value I bring, before potential overflows occur.To recruiters, hiring managers, and teams looking for a passionate and skilled Data Professional who can contribute to your success, let's connect. Let's solve this problem together and create a successful outcome, recognizing talent before it's lost.Feel free to check out my work here: https://lnkd.in/gU-vBwJBhashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AI hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#Recursion hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#InternationalTalent hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#OPT hashtag#Student hashtag#NewGrad hashtag#EntryLevelJobs hashtag#DiversityInTech

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

I'm also conscious that this loop, without resolution, risks a ""stack overflow"" - not just for me, but for many talented individuals facing similar challenges.Consider me a well-optimized algorithm ready to execute across multiple data domains:* 𝗡𝗟𝗣 & 𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁: Designing and deploying intelligent systems that learn and adapt.* 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿: Deploying and optimizing scalable(CI/CD) solutions across cloud environments(Azure, AWS).* 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Transforming raw data into actionable insights and compelling narratives.* 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵: Always refining my skills and approaching problem solving with a growth mindset.I'm seeking a role as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Analyst where my technical skills and problem-solving abilities can create significant impact. I believe a brief conversation can provide the base case needed to break this recursion loop and demonstrate the value I bring, before potential overflows occur.To recruiters, hiring managers, and teams looking for a passionate and skilled Data Professional who can contribute to your success, let's connect. Let's solve this problem together and create a successful outcome, recognizing talent before it's lost.Feel free to check out my work here: https://lnkd.in/gU-vBwJBhashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AI hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#Recursion hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#InternationalTalent hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#OPT hashtag#Student hashtag#NewGrad hashtag#EntryLevelJobs hashtag#DiversityInTech

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

I understand the constraints, but I'm determined to find the company/ organization that recognizes talent beyond the initial conditions. I'm also conscious that this loop, without resolution, risks a ""stack overflow"" - not just for me, but for many talented individuals facing similar challenges.Consider me a well-optimized algorithm ready to execute across multiple data domains:* 𝗡𝗟𝗣 & 𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁: Designing and deploying intelligent systems that learn and adapt.* 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿: Deploying and optimizing scalable(CI/CD) solutions across cloud environments(Azure, AWS).* 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Transforming raw data into actionable insights and compelling narratives.* 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵: Always refining my skills and approaching problem solving with a growth mindset.I'm seeking a role as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Analyst where my technical skills and problem-solving abilities can create significant impact.

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

I'm also conscious that this loop, without resolution, risks a ""stack overflow"" - not just for me, but for many talented individuals facing similar challenges.Consider me a well-optimized algorithm ready to execute across multiple data domains:* 𝗡𝗟𝗣 & 𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁: Designing and deploying intelligent systems that learn and adapt.* 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿: Deploying and optimizing scalable(CI/CD) solutions across cloud environments(Azure, AWS).* 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Transforming raw data into actionable insights and compelling narratives.* 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵: Always refining my skills and approaching problem solving with a growth mindset.I'm seeking a role as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Analyst where my technical skills and problem-solving abilities can create significant impact. I believe a brief conversation can provide the base case needed to break this recursion loop and demonstrate the value I bring, before potential overflows occur.To recruiters, hiring managers, and teams looking for a passionate and skilled Data Professional who can contribute to your success, let's connect. Let's solve this problem together and create a successful outcome, recognizing talent before it's lost.Feel free to check out my work here: https://lnkd.in/gU-vBwJBhashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AI hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#Recursion hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#InternationalTalent hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#OPT hashtag#Student hashtag#NewGrad hashtag#EntryLevelJobs hashtag#DiversityInTech

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

I'm also conscious that this loop, without resolution, risks a ""stack overflow"" - not just for me, but for many talented individuals facing similar challenges.Consider me a well-optimized algorithm ready to execute across multiple data domains:* 𝗡𝗟𝗣 & 𝗔𝗜 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁: Designing and deploying intelligent systems that learn and adapt.* 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿: Deploying and optimizing scalable(CI/CD) solutions across cloud environments(Azure, AWS).* 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Transforming raw data into actionable insights and compelling narratives.* 𝗗𝗲𝗯𝘂𝗴𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗠𝘆 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵: Always refining my skills and approaching problem solving with a growth mindset.I'm seeking a role as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Analyst where my technical skills and problem-solving abilities can create significant impact. I believe a brief conversation can provide the base case needed to break this recursion loop and demonstrate the value I bring, before potential overflows occur.To recruiters, hiring managers, and teams looking for a passionate and skilled Data Professional who can contribute to your success, let's connect. Let's solve this problem together and create a successful outcome, recognizing talent before it's lost.Feel free to check out my work here: https://lnkd.in/gU-vBwJBhashtag#DataScience hashtag#MachineLearning hashtag#AI hashtag#AWS hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#Recursion hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#InternationalTalent hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#OPT hashtag#Student hashtag#NewGrad hashtag#EntryLevelJobs hashtag#DiversityInTech

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

"Edy Carolina Arroyo, MBA 🍋Edy Carolina Arroyo, MBA 🍋",,"You think you know your ideal customer.But if you're like 66% of new brands, you're guessing it.(and it’s killing your GTM strategy)The problem?Many brands focus on surface-level traits.Job title, company size, and industry don’t tell the whole story.Demographics show 𝘄𝗵𝗼 your customer is.But behavioral data reveals 𝗵𝗼𝘄 and 𝘄𝗵𝘆 they buy.Without these insights, you waste time chasing the wrong leads.Ones who look good on paper but have zero intention of signingyour DocuSign.You need a clear picture of your ideal customer profile (ICP).Here’s a simple 5-step framework to help you define your ICP 👇1. Start with rejection:Who should NEVER buy from you?→ Identify red flags: wrong budget, wrong mindset, wrong use case.↳ Example: If you offer premium services, anyone seeking a “cheap fix” is not your customer.2. Study your ""wrong"" customers:Look at clients who left or churned.→ Read cancellation reasons, refund requests, and negative reviews.↳ Example: If clients churned because your software was “too complex,” your ICP might need teams with the expertise to handle robust solutions.3. Find the unexpected patterns:Forget job titles—track behavioral triggers instead.→ What event pushed them to buy? A new boss? Missed revenue targets?↳ Example: A training company found their best customers were CEOs needing quick fixes after firing their sales head. So they targeted companies hiring new sales leaders.4. Track the lurkers:Your best leads may not engage, but they watch closely.→ Monitor LinkedIn profile views, newsletter subscribers, and repeat website visitors.↳ Example: If someone visits your pricing page multiple times without booking a call, they might be a high-intent lead—reach out. Tools like PhantomBuster, LinkedIn Navigator, and Clearbit help.5. Flip your funnel:Start with your happiest customers and reverse-engineer their journey.→ What were they struggling with 6 months before finding you?↳ Example: A marketing agency discovered their best clients were DIY-ing their content before hiring them. So they targeted business owners searching for content templates.New brands start at the top of the funnel.Smart ones start at the bottom and work up.Define your ICP clearly to drive growth.This is how you build a successful strategy.Follow me for EC Peasy tips 🍋hashtag#GTM hashtag#marketstrategy hashtag#revenue

Amandeep SekhonAmandeep Sekhon,,"Your systems should work for you, not against you.I’ve spent over 17 years helping businesses untangle messy processes, disconnected tools, and inefficient systems. Here’s what I’ve learned: Technology is only as good as how well it's integrated. Too often, I see companies struggling because: → Their CRM doesn’t “talk” with their ERP. → Teams waste hours on manual tasks that could be automated. → Critical insights are buried under disorganized data. Sound familiar? Here’s how I approach these challenges: ✅ Streamline Systems We unify platforms like CRM, ERP, and cloud solutions so workflows are seamless. No more jumping between tools or losing track. ✅ Automated Efficiency From repetitive tasks like data entry, all automated. Your team focuses on what matters strategy, growth, and innovation. ✅ Data-Driven Decisions We turn raw data chaos (you know, those endless spreadsheets) → actionable insights that drive results. ✅ Built-In Security Scaling shouldn’t compromise security. We ensure systems are secure, compliant, and ready for growth. Why settle for systems that hold you back? Let’s turn your tech stack from frustration → foundation for success.

THEGBSEDGETHEGBSEDGE,,"🔍 How often do we find ourselves buried under a mountain of marketing data, unsure of how to extract actionable insights?In my journey through the global business services landscape, I've encountered many teams overwhelmed by data silos and scattered spreadsheets. The truth is, marketing analytics should empower us, not overwhelm us. When centralized, it transforms into a vital engine driving strategic decisions and amplifying our impact.💡 Imagine this: all your marketing insights in one cohesive platform. This is not just a dream—it's essential for making informed decisions, identifying trends, and optimizing resources. Brands are missing out by not leveraging this powerful approach.Here are some key steps to get started with centralized marketing analytics:1️⃣ Invest in the right integration tools.2️⃣ Standardize your data entry processes to maintain consistency.3️⃣ Train your team to effectively leverage these tools.But beware! Even the best plans can falter. Watch out for common pitfalls like neglecting data quality, falling into information overload, and failing to train your team adequately.✨ Remember, centralized analytics is more than just numbers. It’s about crafting stories that illuminate customer journeys, showcase success, and project future trends. Telling a compelling story with your data makes it relatable and actionable.Developing a culture driven by data is crucial. Celebrate wins that stem from data-informed decisions and empower your team to experiment with analytics freely.As we've seen, streamlining marketing analytics isn't just about operational efficiency—it's a pathway to unlocking significant opportunities. 💭 Reflect on this: What changes can you make today to ensure your marketing data is providing real value to your organization? hashtag#MarketingAnalytics hashtag#DataDriven hashtag#GBS hashtag#SharedServices

Samuel ChukwudozieSamuel Chukwudozie,,"I recently came across a review of the Google Data Analytics course, where the reviewer gave it a 3/10 rating. While I understand their point that the course only covers the basics and doesn't dive deep into topics like SQL, Tableau, and R, I have to respectfully disagree.As someone who's passionate about lifelong learning, I believe that a wise student shouldn't just stop at the course material. Instead, we should use it as a starting point and do our own research to dive deeper into the topics.My culture of learning has always been to go beyond the surface level and seek out the underlying principles. I encourage all students, whether you're taking the Google Data Analytics course or any other, to adopt this mindset.Don't just take things at face value - dig deeper, ask questions, and keep improving your skills. The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing.Let's keep pushing ourselves to be better and stay curious! hashtag#lifelonglearning hashtag#datanalytics hashtag#googledataanalytics hashtag#learningmindset hashtag#MathsTutor

"Edy Carolina Arroyo, MBA 🍋Edy Carolina Arroyo, MBA 🍋",,"You think you know your ideal customer.But if you're like 66% of new brands, you're guessing it.(and it’s killing your GTM strategy)The problem?Many brands focus on surface-level traits.Job title, company size, and industry don’t tell the whole story.Demographics show 𝘄𝗵𝗼 your customer is.But behavioral data reveals 𝗵𝗼𝘄 and 𝘄𝗵𝘆 they buy.Without these insights, you waste time chasing the wrong leads.Ones who look good on paper but have zero intention of signingyour DocuSign.You need a clear picture of your ideal customer profile (ICP).Here’s a simple 5-step framework to help you define your ICP 👇1. Start with rejection:Who should NEVER buy from you?→ Identify red flags: wrong budget, wrong mindset, wrong use case.↳ Example: If you offer premium services, anyone seeking a “cheap fix” is not your customer.2. Study your ""wrong"" customers:Look at clients who left or churned.→ Read cancellation reasons, refund requests, and negative reviews.↳ Example: If clients churned because your software was “too complex,” your ICP might need teams with the expertise to handle robust solutions.3. Find the unexpected patterns:Forget job titles—track behavioral triggers instead.→ What event pushed them to buy? A new boss? Missed revenue targets?↳ Example: A training company found their best customers were CEOs needing quick fixes after firing their sales head. So they targeted companies hiring new sales leaders.4. Track the lurkers:Your best leads may not engage, but they watch closely.→ Monitor LinkedIn profile views, newsletter subscribers, and repeat website visitors.↳ Example: If someone visits your pricing page multiple times without booking a call, they might be a high-intent lead—reach out. Tools like PhantomBuster, LinkedIn Navigator, and Clearbit help.5. Flip your funnel:Start with your happiest customers and reverse-engineer their journey.→ What were they struggling with 6 months before finding you?↳ Example: A marketing agency discovered their best clients were DIY-ing their content before hiring them. So they targeted business owners searching for content templates.New brands start at the top of the funnel.Smart ones start at the bottom and work up.Define your ICP clearly to drive growth.This is how you build a successful strategy.Follow me for EC Peasy tips 🍋hashtag#GTM hashtag#marketstrategy hashtag#revenue
