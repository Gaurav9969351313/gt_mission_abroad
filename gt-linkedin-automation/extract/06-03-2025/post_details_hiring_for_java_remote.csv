Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth.

Inyang AsuquoInyang Asuquo,,"Misconceptions About Remote Work—And Why We Deserve Some RespectA laptop in the hands of a young African? Some people assume fraud before they think “hardworking remote worker.” Meanwhile, we’re out here chasing unpaid invoices and dodging bad WiFi.""Remote jobs let you escape bad bosses.""A bad boss in an office is annoying. A bad remote boss? Invisible but all-seeing. They will:Spam you with “quick updates” at midnight.Schedule Zoom meetings for no reason.Assume you’re lazy because they can’t see your stress.""Remote jobs make hiring more diverse.""Yet many companies still:Favor certain locations (good luck applying from Africa or Asia).Judge video call backgrounds (not everyone has a Pinterest home office).Assume bad internet = bad worker (blame the network providers, not us).""Remote jobs are easier to get.""No. These jobs are so competitive, even your CV needs a CV.""You can work from anywhere.""Try working from a café, and your Wi-Fi dies mid-meeting. Or time zones turn your “flexible job” into a 2 AM shift.Respect a Remote Worker When You See OneWe hustle just as hard—sometimes harder. We fight bad WiFi, global competition, and stereotypes. So next time you meet a remote worker, show some love (or better yet, stable electricity).💬 Tag a remote worker who can relate!hashtag#alxnigeriasquad18 hashtag#30dayschallenge hashtag#ownurspace hashtag#30daysofconsistency

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth.

Inyang AsuquoInyang Asuquo,,"Misconceptions About Remote Work—And Why We Deserve Some RespectA laptop in the hands of a young African? Some people assume fraud before they think “hardworking remote worker.” Meanwhile, we’re out here chasing unpaid invoices and dodging bad WiFi.""Remote jobs let you escape bad bosses.""A bad boss in an office is annoying. A bad remote boss? Invisible but all-seeing. They will:Spam you with “quick updates” at midnight.Schedule Zoom meetings for no reason.Assume you’re lazy because they can’t see your stress.""Remote jobs make hiring more diverse.""Yet many companies still:Favor certain locations (good luck applying from Africa or Asia).Judge video call backgrounds (not everyone has a Pinterest home office).Assume bad internet = bad worker (blame the network providers, not us).""Remote jobs are easier to get.""No. These jobs are so competitive, even your CV needs a CV.""You can work from anywhere.""Try working from a café, and your Wi-Fi dies mid-meeting. Or time zones turn your “flexible job” into a 2 AM shift.Respect a Remote Worker When You See OneWe hustle just as hard—sometimes harder. We fight bad WiFi, global competition, and stereotypes. So next time you meet a remote worker, show some love (or better yet, stable electricity).💬 Tag a remote worker who can relate!hashtag#alxnigeriasquad18 hashtag#30dayschallenge hashtag#ownurspace hashtag#30daysofconsistency

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth.

Inyang AsuquoInyang Asuquo,,"Misconceptions About Remote Work—And Why We Deserve Some RespectA laptop in the hands of a young African? Some people assume fraud before they think “hardworking remote worker.” Meanwhile, we’re out here chasing unpaid invoices and dodging bad WiFi.""Remote jobs let you escape bad bosses.""A bad boss in an office is annoying. A bad remote boss? Invisible but all-seeing. They will:Spam you with “quick updates” at midnight.Schedule Zoom meetings for no reason.Assume you’re lazy because they can’t see your stress.""Remote jobs make hiring more diverse.""Yet many companies still:Favor certain locations (good luck applying from Africa or Asia).Judge video call backgrounds (not everyone has a Pinterest home office).Assume bad internet = bad worker (blame the network providers, not us).""Remote jobs are easier to get.""No. These jobs are so competitive, even your CV needs a CV.""You can work from anywhere.""Try working from a café, and your Wi-Fi dies mid-meeting. Or time zones turn your “flexible job” into a 2 AM shift.Respect a Remote Worker When You See OneWe hustle just as hard—sometimes harder. We fight bad WiFi, global competition, and stereotypes. So next time you meet a remote worker, show some love (or better yet, stable electricity).💬 Tag a remote worker who can relate!hashtag#alxnigeriasquad18 hashtag#30dayschallenge hashtag#ownurspace hashtag#30daysofconsistency

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Daniil MiashynDaniil Miashyn,,"Office vs. Home – My ExperienceI’ve worked both in the office and at home, and each has its perks. But for me, working from home wins.🏠 Why I Prefer Working from Home: •	No traffic—just a short walk from the bed to the desk. •	If I’m tired, I can take a quick nap (or at least think about it). •	I can start working when my customers need me, not when the boss says so. •	When work slows down, I can spend time with my kid or help my wife (which, honestly, makes life better). •	Borders between work and life disappear—I’m always there for my family.🏢 What I Miss About the Office: •	Friends and fun—we had a great time there. •	The energy of the office can be motivating. •	No temptation to take a “quick” YouTube break that turns into 30 minutes.And yet, sometimes I’m not sure if blurring the lines between work and home is a blessing or a curse. Being constantly available for family is great, but at the same time, work never really “ends.”Where do you work better: home or office?

They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Daniil MiashynDaniil Miashyn,,"Office vs. Home – My ExperienceI’ve worked both in the office and at home, and each has its perks. But for me, working from home wins.🏠 Why I Prefer Working from Home: •	No traffic—just a short walk from the bed to the desk. •	If I’m tired, I can take a quick nap (or at least think about it). •	I can start working when my customers need me, not when the boss says so. •	When work slows down, I can spend time with my kid or help my wife (which, honestly, makes life better). •	Borders between work and life disappear—I’m always there for my family.🏢 What I Miss About the Office: •	Friends and fun—we had a great time there. •	The energy of the office can be motivating. •	No temptation to take a “quick” YouTube break that turns into 30 minutes.And yet, sometimes I’m not sure if blurring the lines between work and home is a blessing or a curse. Being constantly available for family is great, but at the same time, work never really “ends.”Where do you work better: home or office?

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Daniil MiashynDaniil Miashyn,,"Office vs. Home – My ExperienceI’ve worked both in the office and at home, and each has its perks. But for me, working from home wins.🏠 Why I Prefer Working from Home: •	No traffic—just a short walk from the bed to the desk. •	If I’m tired, I can take a quick nap (or at least think about it). •	I can start working when my customers need me, not when the boss says so. •	When work slows down, I can spend time with my kid or help my wife (which, honestly, makes life better). •	Borders between work and life disappear—I’m always there for my family.🏢 What I Miss About the Office: •	Friends and fun—we had a great time there. •	The energy of the office can be motivating. •	No temptation to take a “quick” YouTube break that turns into 30 minutes.And yet, sometimes I’m not sure if blurring the lines between work and home is a blessing or a curse. Being constantly available for family is great, but at the same time, work never really “ends.”Where do you work better: home or office?

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Daniil MiashynDaniil Miashyn,,"Office vs. Home – My ExperienceI’ve worked both in the office and at home, and each has its perks. But for me, working from home wins.🏠 Why I Prefer Working from Home: •	No traffic—just a short walk from the bed to the desk. •	If I’m tired, I can take a quick nap (or at least think about it). •	I can start working when my customers need me, not when the boss says so. •	When work slows down, I can spend time with my kid or help my wife (which, honestly, makes life better). •	Borders between work and life disappear—I’m always there for my family.🏢 What I Miss About the Office: •	Friends and fun—we had a great time there. •	The energy of the office can be motivating. •	No temptation to take a “quick” YouTube break that turns into 30 minutes.And yet, sometimes I’m not sure if blurring the lines between work and home is a blessing or a curse. Being constantly available for family is great, but at the same time, work never really “ends.”Where do you work better: home or office?

Malik Irfan SanwalMalik Irfan Sanwal,,"The workplace looks different now than it did 10 years ago. The way employees work, learn, and grow has transformed. Here’s what has changed:📌 Flexible work: Remote work is more common. Employees don’t have to be tied to a desk anymore.📌 Learning on the go: Ten years ago, you had to attend training sessions. Now, with online courses and resources, employees are learning new skills all the time.📌 Work-life balance: More employees are setting boundaries. They value time with family and personal growth.📌 Focus on mental health: Companies now understand the importance of mental well-being. This wasn’t the case a decade ago.📌 Collaboration: Teams work across borders. Tools like Slack and Zoom make it easy to connect with anyone, anywhere.Despite the changes, many employers still don’t fully trust employees to manage their own time. Micromanaging continues, and some employees feel pressured to prove themselves constantly. It creates stress and doesn’t allow for growth. I’ve worked with many who feel this burden and it impacts their performance.Growth comes from embracing new ways of working. How has your workplace changed in the last 10 years?

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Daniil MiashynDaniil Miashyn,,"Office vs. Home – My ExperienceI’ve worked both in the office and at home, and each has its perks. But for me, working from home wins.🏠 Why I Prefer Working from Home: •	No traffic—just a short walk from the bed to the desk. •	If I’m tired, I can take a quick nap (or at least think about it). •	I can start working when my customers need me, not when the boss says so. •	When work slows down, I can spend time with my kid or help my wife (which, honestly, makes life better). •	Borders between work and life disappear—I’m always there for my family.🏢 What I Miss About the Office: •	Friends and fun—we had a great time there. •	The energy of the office can be motivating. •	No temptation to take a “quick” YouTube break that turns into 30 minutes.And yet, sometimes I’m not sure if blurring the lines between work and home is a blessing or a curse. Being constantly available for family is great, but at the same time, work never really “ends.”Where do you work better: home or office?
