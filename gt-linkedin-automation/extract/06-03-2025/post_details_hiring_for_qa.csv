Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from?

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work?

If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Aidyn HillyardAidyn Hillyard,,"That QA vibe when you discover a bug in the Unemployment Insurance pipeline. 😏 Whatever testing they implemented validated information can be submitted through the form... but it looks like no one checked the full end-to-end process.I was contacted today and informed that several of my job search entries aren't displaying in their system, and they suspect it's due to punctuation.  It turns out that their form will let me submit a job title like ""Sr. QA Engineer"" or ""Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer"" but their system cannot parse the data if it contains punctuation like periods and parentheses.This is actually the second bug I've discovered on their site (the first involved a System.InvalidCastException in their Visual Basic code, and I submitted a full bug report, complete with steps to repro, expected behavior, and screenshots).The fact that the person who contacted me suspected punctuation is the culprit tells me this isn't an unknown bug, but they aren't addressing it, possibly because they're working on a ""modernization"" project.  The testing phase for that is coming up next, so I hope their QA efforts truly do take an end-to-end approach for data validation. 😉Note: This isn't a dig at the UI office!  This is just a reminder that all software has bugs, and an important part of the process is testing for those bugs, discovering them, and fixing them. ✨

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Aidyn HillyardAidyn Hillyard,,"That QA vibe when you discover a bug in the Unemployment Insurance pipeline. 😏 Whatever testing they implemented validated information can be submitted through the form... but it looks like no one checked the full end-to-end process.I was contacted today and informed that several of my job search entries aren't displaying in their system, and they suspect it's due to punctuation.  It turns out that their form will let me submit a job title like ""Sr. QA Engineer"" or ""Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer"" but their system cannot parse the data if it contains punctuation like periods and parentheses.This is actually the second bug I've discovered on their site (the first involved a System.InvalidCastException in their Visual Basic code, and I submitted a full bug report, complete with steps to repro, expected behavior, and screenshots).The fact that the person who contacted me suspected punctuation is the culprit tells me this isn't an unknown bug, but they aren't addressing it, possibly because they're working on a ""modernization"" project.  The testing phase for that is coming up next, so I hope their QA efforts truly do take an end-to-end approach for data validation. 😉Note: This isn't a dig at the UI office!  This is just a reminder that all software has bugs, and an important part of the process is testing for those bugs, discovering them, and fixing them. ✨

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Aidyn HillyardAidyn Hillyard,,"That QA vibe when you discover a bug in the Unemployment Insurance pipeline. 😏 Whatever testing they implemented validated information can be submitted through the form... but it looks like no one checked the full end-to-end process.I was contacted today and informed that several of my job search entries aren't displaying in their system, and they suspect it's due to punctuation.  It turns out that their form will let me submit a job title like ""Sr. QA Engineer"" or ""Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer"" but their system cannot parse the data if it contains punctuation like periods and parentheses.This is actually the second bug I've discovered on their site (the first involved a System.InvalidCastException in their Visual Basic code, and I submitted a full bug report, complete with steps to repro, expected behavior, and screenshots).The fact that the person who contacted me suspected punctuation is the culprit tells me this isn't an unknown bug, but they aren't addressing it, possibly because they're working on a ""modernization"" project.  The testing phase for that is coming up next, so I hope their QA efforts truly do take an end-to-end approach for data validation. 😉Note: This isn't a dig at the UI office!  This is just a reminder that all software has bugs, and an important part of the process is testing for those bugs, discovering them, and fixing them. ✨

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Aidyn HillyardAidyn Hillyard,,"That QA vibe when you discover a bug in the Unemployment Insurance pipeline. 😏 Whatever testing they implemented validated information can be submitted through the form... but it looks like no one checked the full end-to-end process.I was contacted today and informed that several of my job search entries aren't displaying in their system, and they suspect it's due to punctuation.  It turns out that their form will let me submit a job title like ""Sr. QA Engineer"" or ""Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer"" but their system cannot parse the data if it contains punctuation like periods and parentheses.This is actually the second bug I've discovered on their site (the first involved a System.InvalidCastException in their Visual Basic code, and I submitted a full bug report, complete with steps to repro, expected behavior, and screenshots).The fact that the person who contacted me suspected punctuation is the culprit tells me this isn't an unknown bug, but they aren't addressing it, possibly because they're working on a ""modernization"" project.  The testing phase for that is coming up next, so I hope their QA efforts truly do take an end-to-end approach for data validation. 😉Note: This isn't a dig at the UI office!  This is just a reminder that all software has bugs, and an important part of the process is testing for those bugs, discovering them, and fixing them. ✨

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Aidyn HillyardAidyn Hillyard,,"That QA vibe when you discover a bug in the Unemployment Insurance pipeline. 😏 Whatever testing they implemented validated information can be submitted through the form... but it looks like no one checked the full end-to-end process.I was contacted today and informed that several of my job search entries aren't displaying in their system, and they suspect it's due to punctuation.  It turns out that their form will let me submit a job title like ""Sr. QA Engineer"" or ""Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer"" but their system cannot parse the data if it contains punctuation like periods and parentheses.This is actually the second bug I've discovered on their site (the first involved a System.InvalidCastException in their Visual Basic code, and I submitted a full bug report, complete with steps to repro, expected behavior, and screenshots).The fact that the person who contacted me suspected punctuation is the culprit tells me this isn't an unknown bug, but they aren't addressing it, possibly because they're working on a ""modernization"" project.  The testing phase for that is coming up next, so I hope their QA efforts truly do take an end-to-end approach for data validation. 😉Note: This isn't a dig at the UI office!  This is just a reminder that all software has bugs, and an important part of the process is testing for those bugs, discovering them, and fixing them. ✨

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Aidyn HillyardAidyn Hillyard,,"That QA vibe when you discover a bug in the Unemployment Insurance pipeline. 😏 Whatever testing they implemented validated information can be submitted through the form... but it looks like no one checked the full end-to-end process.I was contacted today and informed that several of my job search entries aren't displaying in their system, and they suspect it's due to punctuation.  It turns out that their form will let me submit a job title like ""Sr. QA Engineer"" or ""Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer"" but their system cannot parse the data if it contains punctuation like periods and parentheses.This is actually the second bug I've discovered on their site (the first involved a System.InvalidCastException in their Visual Basic code, and I submitted a full bug report, complete with steps to repro, expected behavior, and screenshots).The fact that the person who contacted me suspected punctuation is the culprit tells me this isn't an unknown bug, but they aren't addressing it, possibly because they're working on a ""modernization"" project.  The testing phase for that is coming up next, so I hope their QA efforts truly do take an end-to-end approach for data validation. 😉Note: This isn't a dig at the UI office!  This is just a reminder that all software has bugs, and an important part of the process is testing for those bugs, discovering them, and fixing them. ✨

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Aidyn HillyardAidyn Hillyard,,"That QA vibe when you discover a bug in the Unemployment Insurance pipeline. 😏 Whatever testing they implemented validated information can be submitted through the form... but it looks like no one checked the full end-to-end process.I was contacted today and informed that several of my job search entries aren't displaying in their system, and they suspect it's due to punctuation.  It turns out that their form will let me submit a job title like ""Sr. QA Engineer"" or ""Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer"" but their system cannot parse the data if it contains punctuation like periods and parentheses.This is actually the second bug I've discovered on their site (the first involved a System.InvalidCastException in their Visual Basic code, and I submitted a full bug report, complete with steps to repro, expected behavior, and screenshots).The fact that the person who contacted me suspected punctuation is the culprit tells me this isn't an unknown bug, but they aren't addressing it, possibly because they're working on a ""modernization"" project.  The testing phase for that is coming up next, so I hope their QA efforts truly do take an end-to-end approach for data validation. 😉Note: This isn't a dig at the UI office!  This is just a reminder that all software has bugs, and an important part of the process is testing for those bugs, discovering them, and fixing them. ✨

Jesse LandryJesse Landry,,"The ELC Roundtable in New York, a couple of weeks back, wasn’t just another tech meetup. It was a fountain of ideas, a live-wire conversation on AI’s impact on hashtag#softwareengineering that could have doubled as the script for a high-stakes HBO drama. If you weren’t in the room, let me bring you up to speed.Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Funmi Oludaiye and Alpha Bah led the charge, bringing together a room full of hashtag#engineeringleaders, hashtag#AIenthusiasts, and people who are about to have their entire job descriptions rewritten by machines that never sleep, never get distracted, and don’t ask for a raise. Sponsored by Eclipse, the discussion wasn’t about whether AI will change software engineering, it was about how deep the shift will cut, who will adapt, and who will be left re-skilling in real time.AI isn’t coming for software engineering. It’s already here, and if you still think hashtag#promptengineering is a gimmick, you haven’t been paying attention. The conversation broke down into groups, tackling AI-driven developer productivity, the rise of hybrid technical and soft skills, and whether software engineers of the future will even need to know how to code, or if they’ll just become AI whisperers, negotiating with hashtag#LLMs instead of writing functions.One point was clear: The fundamentals still matter. Understanding hashtag#businessproblems, hashtag#architecturalthinking, and real problem-solving can’t be outsourced to AI (yet). But if you’re coming into the field now, should you study software engineering or hashtag#machinelearning? At Meta, for example, traditional engineering roles are already being swapped out for hashtag#MLengineers. If you’re still writing bubble sort algorithms for fun, it might be time to reconsider your hobbies.And then there’s the bigger question: What happens when AI becomes good enough to write, refactor, and deploy entire systems autonomously? We’ve already got AI-driven hashtag#QA, AI-driven hashtag#codereview, AI-driven hashtag#securityanalysis. The natural next step? AI-driven architecture. AI-driven strategy. AI-driven business decisions. You get where this is going.The conversation didn’t just stay technical. It stretched into hashtag#hiring, hashtag#education, and the social impact of AI. If AI makes software development exponentially faster, what happens to the junior engineers who traditionally cut their teeth on the grunt work? If AI optimizes everything, where’s the next generation of hashtag#CTOs coming from? If AI is replacing hashtag#humaninteraction in engineering, what’s stopping it from doing the same in hashtag#socialinteractions, leadership, and even creativity?Grateful to be welcomed into the conversation - TY Luxi (Lucy) Huang, CFA, Alpha Bah, Bosun Gidigbi, Maya Kumits, Brian Guthrie, Cory Showers, Ben Williamson for an insightful chat. 🙏 hashtag#Networking hashtag#PeerLearning hashtag#Community hashtag#AI hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#FutureOfDevelopment hashtag#WhatIsWorkExactly (Brain melting question 🫠)

Aidyn HillyardAidyn Hillyard,,"That QA vibe when you discover a bug in the Unemployment Insurance pipeline. 😏 Whatever testing they implemented validated information can be submitted through the form... but it looks like no one checked the full end-to-end process.I was contacted today and informed that several of my job search entries aren't displaying in their system, and they suspect it's due to punctuation.  It turns out that their form will let me submit a job title like ""Sr. QA Engineer"" or ""Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer"" but their system cannot parse the data if it contains punctuation like periods and parentheses.This is actually the second bug I've discovered on their site (the first involved a System.InvalidCastException in their Visual Basic code, and I submitted a full bug report, complete with steps to repro, expected behavior, and screenshots).The fact that the person who contacted me suspected punctuation is the culprit tells me this isn't an unknown bug, but they aren't addressing it, possibly because they're working on a ""modernization"" project.  The testing phase for that is coming up next, so I hope their QA efforts truly do take an end-to-end approach for data validation. 😉Note: This isn't a dig at the UI office!  This is just a reminder that all software has bugs, and an important part of the process is testing for those bugs, discovering them, and fixing them. ✨

While some organizations succeed without a dedicated QA function, many struggle with developer burnout, customer service overload, and release instability—challenges that demand a proactive quality strategy rather than reactive fixes.The insights on building a test function, hiring strategies, and leveraging fractional QA leadership offer practical guidance for organizations aiming to scale effectively.
