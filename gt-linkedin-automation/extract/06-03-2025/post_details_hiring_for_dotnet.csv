WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market!

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market!

Purvang DavePurvang Dave,,"❌ Just work on your tech skills, and you'll land a job!❌ Spray your resume everywhere, something will stick!❌ Remote jobs are the best way to start out!💡 WRONG. WRONG. AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry! Looking forward to applying these insights and connecting with like-minded professionals.So, are you playing the job market right? Or are you still sending out 100 applications and wondering why you’re ghosted?Drop your thoughts below!

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value. Develop skills. Train people. Create impact. The world doesn’t need more people waiting for opportunities—it needs more people creating them! 🌍🚀🔹 Which side do you fall on?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value. Develop skills. Train people. Create impact. The world doesn’t need more people waiting for opportunities—it needs more people creating them! 🌍🚀🔹 Which side do you fall on? Are you building yourself, or just waiting for an opportunity to come your way? Let’s discuss in the comments! 💬👇

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market!

Purvang DavePurvang Dave,,"❌ Just work on your tech skills, and you'll land a job!❌ Spray your resume everywhere, something will stick!❌ Remote jobs are the best way to start out!💡 WRONG. WRONG. AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry! Looking forward to applying these insights and connecting with like-minded professionals.So, are you playing the job market right? Or are you still sending out 100 applications and wondering why you’re ghosted?Drop your thoughts below! Let’s talk strategies.👇🔥hashtag#ICTCareers hashtag#GameChanger hashtag#ACSWorkshop hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#StandOut hashtag#MigrantSuccess hashtag#JobSearchHacks

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value. Develop skills. Train people. Create impact. The world doesn’t need more people waiting for opportunities—it needs more people creating them! 🌍🚀🔹 Which side do you fall on? Are you building yourself, or just waiting for an opportunity to come your way? Let’s discuss in the comments! 💬👇

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value. Develop skills. Train people. Create impact. The world doesn’t need more people waiting for opportunities—it needs more people creating them! 🌍🚀🔹 Which side do you fall on? Are you building yourself, or just waiting for an opportunity to come your way? Let’s discuss in the comments! 💬👇

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value. Develop skills. Train people. Create impact. The world doesn’t need more people waiting for opportunities—it needs more people creating them! 🌍🚀🔹 Which side do you fall on?

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market!

Purvang DavePurvang Dave,,"❌ Just work on your tech skills, and you'll land a job!❌ Spray your resume everywhere, something will stick!❌ Remote jobs are the best way to start out!💡 WRONG. WRONG. AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry! Looking forward to applying these insights and connecting with like-minded professionals.So, are you playing the job market right? Or are you still sending out 100 applications and wondering why you’re ghosted?Drop your thoughts below!

But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews. And if you're making these mistakes, it NEVER will:🔴 Missing location – Why is the city missing from your contact details? Basic, yet critical 🔴 Bolded words in the Summary – Who told you this works? It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English. You’ll work in English. Why is this here?🔴 Comma-separated skills list – Unreadable. No context. No mapping. No purpose.Want to fix this mess & get into the UK job market the RIGHT way? 📩 DM me now for a proper, recruiter-validated resume that actually gets interviewsBecause right now, your resume isn’t working for you.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value. Develop skills. Train people. Create impact. The world doesn’t need more people waiting for opportunities—it needs more people creating them! 🌍🚀🔹 Which side do you fall on?

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

This is WHY hashtag#internationalstudents are STRUGGLING to land jobs in the UK despite Strathclyde credential 🇬🇧📌 You paid £31,100 for your MSc. in hashtag#InternationalBusiness at a UK university, while home students pay half that amount (hashtag#Strathclyde) hashtag#StrathclydeUniversity 📌 You got minimal to no career support, and now you’re out in the market, competing with thousands of others.📌 And yet, THIS is the quality of resume that’s floating around? No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews. And if you're making these mistakes, it NEVER will:🔴 Missing location – Why is the city missing from your contact details? Basic, yet critical 🔴 Bolded words in the Summary – Who told you this works? It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English. You’ll work in English. Why is this here?🔴 Comma-separated skills list – Unreadable. No context. No mapping. No purpose.Want to fix this mess & get into the UK job market the RIGHT way? 📩 DM me now for a proper, recruiter-validated resume that actually gets interviewsBecause right now, your resume isn’t working for you.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market!

Purvang DavePurvang Dave,,"❌ Just work on your tech skills, and you'll land a job!❌ Spray your resume everywhere, something will stick!❌ Remote jobs are the best way to start out!💡 WRONG. WRONG. AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry! Looking forward to applying these insights and connecting with like-minded professionals.So, are you playing the job market right? Or are you still sending out 100 applications and wondering why you’re ghosted?Drop your thoughts below!

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different.

No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews. And if you're making these mistakes, it NEVER will:🔴 Missing location – Why is the city missing from your contact details? Basic, yet critical 🔴 Bolded words in the Summary – Who told you this works? It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English. You’ll work in English. Why is this here?🔴 Comma-separated skills list – Unreadable. No context. No mapping. No purpose.Want to fix this mess & get into the UK job market the RIGHT way? 📩 DM me now for a proper, recruiter-validated resume that actually gets interviewsBecause right now, your resume isn’t working for you.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews. And if you're making these mistakes, it NEVER will:🔴 Missing location – Why is the city missing from your contact details? Basic, yet critical 🔴 Bolded words in the Summary – Who told you this works? It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews.

It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews. And if you're making these mistakes, it NEVER will:🔴 Missing location – Why is the city missing from your contact details? Basic, yet critical 🔴 Bolded words in the Summary – Who told you this works? It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English.

WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Purvang DavePurvang Dave,,"❌ Just work on your tech skills, and you'll land a job!❌ Spray your resume everywhere, something will stick!❌ Remote jobs are the best way to start out!💡 WRONG. WRONG. AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry! Looking forward to applying these insights and connecting with like-minded professionals.So, are you playing the job market right? Or are you still sending out 100 applications and wondering why you’re ghosted?Drop your thoughts below!

But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews.

It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English. You’ll work in English. Why is this here?🔴 Comma-separated skills list – Unreadable. No context. No mapping. No purpose.Want to fix this mess & get into the UK job market the RIGHT way? 📩 DM me now for a proper, recruiter-validated resume that actually gets interviewsBecause right now, your resume isn’t working for you.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

Favour OkoreFavour Okore,,"🚀 Dear Job Seekers & Recruiters: Stop Seeking ""Already Made"" – Become Valuable Instead! 🎯💡There’s a widespread mindset that’s affecting career growth and recruitment today:👉 Job seekers want to work for an already successful company, where things are smooth, established, and thriving.👉 Employers want to hire only ""already made"" professionals with years of experience, tons of skills, and zero need for training.⚠️ But here’s the issue: If everyone wants an ""already made"" opportunity, WHO IS MAKING THINGS? 🤔🔥 Job Seekers: Build Yourself, Don’t Just Seek a Ready-Made Company!Many people are desperately looking for jobs in successful organizations. But are you a successful individual yourself?🔹 Instead of chasing big names, build your own value.🔹 Instead of asking, ""Which company will hire me?"" ask, ""What skills do I have that companies NEED?""🔹 Instead of seeking a comfortable environment, develop yourself into someone companies can’t ignore.🌟 When you become a high-value person, you won’t beg for jobs—jobs will find you!🔥 Recruiters: Stop Only Looking for ""Ready-Made"" Employees!Dear employers, not every great employee comes with 10+ years of experience or a perfect resume. Some of the best talents are still growing. Give room for:✔️ Training & mentorship 📚✔️ Hiring based on potential, not just experience 🚀✔️ Creating an environment where people grow into greatness 🌱⚠️ An already made company hiring only already made employees is like a football team recruiting only stars but refusing to train fresh talent. 🏆🎯 The Golden Rule: Made Company + Made Person = Explosive Growth💎 Instead of job seekers looking for an ""already made"" company, they should become valuable enough that even the biggest companies chase after them.💎 Instead of recruiters looking for ""already made"" employees, they should invest in talent and build the next generation of greatness.✨ Be a person of value.

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews.

It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

AND WRONG AGAIN.Yesterday, I attended the ACS (Australian Computer Society) Recruitment Special workshop delivered by the brilliant Mira DSilva, and let me tell you—my perspective on recruitment and job search in Australia completely changed. 🎯💥 The biggest Aha! moment?🔹 Your tech skills? Only 30-35% of the game.🔹 The rest? Business acumen. Domain knowledge. Personal branding. Communication. Relevant experience.🔹 That’s what separates job seekers from job winners.▪️ And if you think remote work is the best way to get started? Think again. The magic happens in hallway conversations, coffee chats, and real human interactions. ❇️ If you’re new, be present, be seen, be heard ❇️ 🔥 The 4-Step Job Search Power Move 🔥1️⃣ First Impressions Matter – Your CV is your handshake before the handshake. Make it impactful.2️⃣ Showcase Skills With Structure – Tell your story, not just your skills.3️⃣ Stand Out or Stay Invisible – What makes you different? OWN IT.4️⃣ Tailor, Don’t Spray & Pray – A generic job search is a losing game. Be strategic.A big thank you to ACS (Australian Computer Society), Rod Dilnutt, Kelsey Capaldo, Manjusha Bhakta and Mira DSilva for this initiative in empowering migrants to excel in the Australian ICT industry!

The Excellence HubThe Excellence Hub,info@theexcellencehub.co.uk,"⚠️ CONTAINS CONTENT SOME PEOPLE MAY FIND UPSETTING!! ⚠️At The Excellence Hub we are determined to play a role in supporting schools with permanent leadership staffing solutions. Luke Bowers and Patrick Ottley-O'Connor oversee this as a small part of their education roles.They have been asked a number of questions recently about this and given that our values are Authenticity, Transparency and Humility we will be all those things below in their responses:1️⃣ Why are you ""doing recruitment"" as part of The Excellence Hub?Great question. We are an education solutions organisation. Sometimes the solution for a school is staffing. We only support with permanent leadership roles as we have well established networks with leaders we've hired, trained and developed. The team has also held pretty much every role in schools and trusts so we genuinely know what you're looking for. There are some incredible recruitment companies in our sector but we also know that the quality of service and value for money are extremely variable.  We want schools to have a different and more affordable alternative. 2️⃣ Why don't you charge more?Awesome question - we've been asked this a lot.We don't need to. It is as simple as that. ✅We have very few overheads✅The majority of our work/income comes from school improvement so we don't rely on this - it's a small portion of the company✅We take on a small number of projects each month to ensure quality and so we can keep the overheads and costs down✅We will do a completely free service once a month for a role of our choosing3️⃣ Do we need to use a recruiter for a leadership role?The honest answer is no, not necessarily. But we will always be honest with you about this. We've had conversations with schools this year who thought they needed a new SLT member. Following a curriculum and staffing review with us it turned out they didn't. We saved the schools £100k with on cost based on a 60 minute free call with us. 4️⃣ Do you have a series of CV's you could send us for our role?No. This isn't how we work and we won't ever do that (if we supported with interim positions this would be essential but we don't).Each project is a fresh new shiny one and we will work with you on a bespoke campaign to target the right candidates in the right way.5️⃣ The recruitment company we work with charge a lot more than you but they've been recruiting for longer and seem more established. Are they better than you?We don't see ourselves as being better or worse than anyone else. What we are is different. We aren't ""recruiters"" but across the team of 20 experts we have all been ""recruiting"" for decades in school and trust leadership roles.⚠️ We know that the next 4-6 weeks are critical in ensuring schools have the right leaders in post for September 2025. 🗓️ If you want to know more about our approach and how we can help you for September 2025 or beyond please get in touch. 📧 info@theexcellencehub.co.uk📞 0345 257 0500

Kaushik KumarKaushik Kumar,,"Strathclyde graduate. PSW running out. Poor resume. In rejection pile. 🚮LIVE resume feedback from my desk. This is WHY hashtag#internationalstudents are STRUGGLING to land jobs in the UK despite Strathclyde credential 🇬🇧📌 You paid £31,100 for your MSc. in hashtag#InternationalBusiness at a UK university, while home students pay half that amount (hashtag#Strathclyde) hashtag#StrathclydeUniversity 📌 You got minimal to no career support, and now you’re out in the market, competing with thousands of others.📌 And yet, THIS is the quality of resume that’s floating around? No wonder job landings aren’t happening.As a recruiter reviewing resumes daily, here’s the harsh truth ⤵️ Your resume isn’t getting you interviews. And if you're making these mistakes, it NEVER will:🔴 Missing location – Why is the city missing from your contact details? Basic, yet critical 🔴 Bolded words in the Summary – Who told you this works? It’s a distraction. Recruiters don’t care for formatting hacks🔴 Vague Career Objective – Your summary must answer:✔️ Who are you?✔️ What have you achieved?✔️ Where do you want to go next?Anything generic = straight to the bin.🔴 No Key Skills section – You expect me to read your whole resume and figure it out myself? Not happening, babe!🔴 Pointless module scores – UK employers don’t care if you got 78% in “Global Business Strategy”. It’s a skills-based market. Want scores to matter? Go back to India where marks > curiosity🔴 Dissertation title only? – Your dissertation is THE most relevant project on your resume. Yet, you’ve given me just a title and expected me to guess what it was about? No tech stack, no impact, no depth = no job🔴 Work experience section full of issues:🚫 American spellings (You’re applying in the UK, hello?)🚫 Generic, meaningless bullet points🚫 Forced quantifiable metrics that don’t add up🔴 Extracurriculars that add no value – More white space = better readability.Cut the fluff🔴 Listing ""English"" as a language skill – You studied in English. You’ll work in English. Why is this here?🔴 Comma-separated skills list – Unreadable. No context. No mapping. No purpose.Want to fix this mess & get into the UK job market the RIGHT way? 📩 DM me now for a proper, recruiter-validated resume that actually gets interviewsBecause right now, your resume isn’t working for you.
