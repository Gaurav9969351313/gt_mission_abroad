Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it.

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.

Oluwafemi AderintoyeOluwafemi Aderintoye,,"""What Do Recruiters Actually Do? (It’s More Than Just Hiring!)""Most people think recruiters just post jobs and wait for candidates to show up. WRONG.Recruiting is like matchmaking but instead of swiping left and right, we’re hunting for top talent, negotiating deals, and making careers happen.Here’s what we REALLY do behind the scenes:🔥 We’re Talent Detectives – We don’t just scan resumes. We dig deep to find hidden gems who aren’t even job hunting yet.📞 We Play Phone Tag... A Lot – Ever wonder why recruiters call so much? Because one phone call can change a career. Your career.💼 We Sell YOU to Companies – You might have the skills, but if no one knows your worth, you’re invisible. We make sure hiring managers see your value.💰 We Fight for Your Worth – That salary negotiation? We handle that. Our job is to make sure you don’t settle for peanuts.⏳ We Save You Time – Instead of applying to 100 jobs and hearing nothing, we get your resume straight to the decision-makers.At the end of the day, a great recruiter isn’t just finding jobs—we’re building careers, creating opportunities, and making sure you land in the RIGHT role.So next time you see a recruiter in your inbox, don’t ignore it. It might just be the message that changes everything.👉 Looking for your next big move?

Irene KennedyIrene Kennedy,,"🚨 Don’t quit your job thinking you’ll land another one overnight 🚨 The job market is tougher than ever and here’s why:1️⃣ Unprecedented competitionThe job market is one of the most competitive in history with thousands of candidates going for the same roles. Right now, the average job posting gets over 250 applicants, making it harder to stand out.2️⃣ Backlog of talent from layoffs and COVIDThe layoffs during the pandemic have created a huge backlog of skilled professionals actively looking for work. These candidates bring years of experience and now they’re all fighting for the same positions. Plus, a lot of experienced people are hesitant to make a move with all the uncertainty, making the competition even tougher.3️⃣ Fewer promotions and internal movementCompanies are promoting less internally these days. They’re focused on cutting costs and staying stable, so there are fewer opportunities for upward mobility. That means people are staying in their current roles longer, which makes it harder to move up.4️⃣ Skill gapsEmployers are looking for highly specialised skills and adaptability. The demand for advanced technical expertise has never been higher and a lot of job seekers are struggling to bridge that gap.🛑What does this mean for you?•Don’t rush into leaving your current role without a solid plan.•Take time to upskill and find ways to stand out from the crowd.•Tap into your network and look for opportunities that aren’t always posted publicly.Most importantly: do not sit at home applying for 100’s of roles, this isn’t working in this competitive talent market! Remember, taking the time to plan your next move carefully is key to landing the right opportunity!***********************************************Hi 👋🏼 I’m Irene Kennedy and I help people navigate and elevate their careers without comporting their health and wellbeing.
