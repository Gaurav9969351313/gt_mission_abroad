Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else.

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what?

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new.

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant.

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else.

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant.

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else.

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant.

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else. Live a barrier-free life.hashtag#ArchitectsOfDubai hashtag#InnovationInDesign hashtag#ArchitecturalVision hashtag#DubaiArchitecture hashtag#BuildingDreams hashtag#CreativityUnleashed hashtag#ArchitecturalInnovation hashtag#FutureOfDesign hashtag#UrbanDevelopment hashtag#BeTheNewYouForYou

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Be The New You For YouBe The New You For You,,"The Architect’s Awakening in Dubai:Rashid had always dreamt of making a name for himself as an architect in Dubai. The city was a playground of futuristic designs, iconic structures, and luxurious developments. After graduating from a reputable university, he joined a mid-sized architectural firm in Business Bay.For the first couple of years, Rashid spent his days drafting blueprints and making adjustments based on his seniors’ feedback. He was talented, but his creativity felt stifled by strict guidelines and never-ending client demands.One day, his firm received a challenging project—to design a mixed-use building in Downtown Dubai that would stand out among the architectural marvels already crowding the skyline. The management invited all architects, including juniors like Rashid, to submit their concepts.Rashid poured his heart into the design, working late nights and spending weekends sketching, erasing, and perfecting. He created something unique—an eco-friendly structure inspired by the desert’s natural curves, incorporating sustainable materials and energy-efficient technologies.When the day came to present his design, his senior architect barely glanced at it before dismissing him. “You’re new. Just focus on learning the basics before trying to innovate,” the senior advised.Disheartened, Rashid left the office late that night, walking along the glittering promenade of Dubai Mall, watching the Burj Khalifa pierce the night sky. “If I can’t showcase my talent here, then where?” he wondered.But instead of giving up, Rashid made a decision: “I have to be the new me for myself, not for anyone else, if I want to live a barrier-free life.”He decided to approach the client directly with his design. When Rashid showed his model to the client, they were impressed. The concept was fresh, innovative, and perfectly suited for Dubai’s forward-thinking aesthetic. After discussions and negotiations, Rashid’s design was selected over others.Within months, his structure began to take shape, and the firm quickly recognized his potential. Rashid was promoted and given the freedom to work on more ambitious projects.One day, as he stood on the rooftop of his newly completed building, overlooking the bustling city below, a young intern approached him. “Sir, I’ve heard your story. What’s your secret?”Rashid smiled and said, “Never let someone else’s limitations become your own. Your creativity is your strength. Own it.”No matter how impossible it seems, you can always break through. Be The New You For You—not for anyone else.

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW

Norma SberaNorma Sbera,,"🌀 Ramadan Drama 2025: A Season of Too Much?Eid Mubarak 🌙 to everyone celebrating—hope you had a restful break.Now that we’re shifting back into work mode, it’s a good moment to reflect on the Ramadan content race. In my last post, I shared some early observations around classification puzzles and shifting content shares across the region.Again, hundreds of series flooded our screens, and we still have the same question:Are we producing more than audiences can consume?📊 At DICM | Dubai International Content Market last year, Ipsos shared that users in the region spend around 2.5 hours per day watching content on online video streaming platforms (connected TVs included).Now ask yourself: ➡️ Did this time double during Ramadan? ➡️ Or even increase by 50%?I believe it stayed the same—at best.Because guess what? Media and entertainment are not the only industries competing for people's time.🧑‍💻 Work hours are reduced, yes—but they don’t disappear 🍽️ The hospitality sector gets busier: Iftar/Suhoor gatherings, outings, family visits 🛍️ The retail industry peaks with night shopping and Ramadan promotions 🕌 And of course, there’s spiritual practice—which is a top priority for many during the monthSo, with all that going on:How much time is really left for +100 series across platforms and broadcasters?🎬 It’s a content marathon with no finish line, and I’m starting to wonder: Who are we making all this content for—and at what cost?💰 How did these productions even work financially? 📉 And are we heading for a correction, or just more of the same next year?hashtag#Ramadan2025 hashtag#ArabTV hashtag#StreamingTrends hashtag#MENAmedia hashtag#ContentStrategy hashtag#AudienceBehavior hashtag#TVTrends hashtag#elCinema hashtag#MediaIndustry

Norman TambachNorman Tambach,,"I spotted a strong signal in the latest EY outlook on the GCC: With GDP growth projected at 3.5% and non-oil sectors gaining pace - particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia - the region is showing real traction in economic diversification.What caught my attention is the combination of robust project pipelines and a projected current account surplus of 8.2% GDP. That's a solid foundation for continued momentum in the banking sector.Clearly, we need to stay alert and vigilant. According to leading economists​, last week's tariffs announcement will have a negative impact on the global economy. It is not such a clear picture what this means for short and long term interest rates. On the positive side​, the GCC economy has a strong starting point, and the region has good relations with the current US administration (demonstrated by ​President T​rump's expected visit to the region in May).​While volatility ​exists, there's still a lot to be optimistic about, but agility will remain key!Read the full report here:​ https://lnkd.in/dhngJ-yW
