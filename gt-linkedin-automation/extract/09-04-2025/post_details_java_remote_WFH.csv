They are predefined by the language and are used to store simple values.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store actual values.ii. Do not have methods or properties.iii. Fixed size and fast access.iv. Stored in memory directly (stack).‚óæ8 Primitive Data Types:i. boolean: Represents true or false.ii. char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.iii. byte: 1 byte, range from: 128 to 127.iv. short: 2 bytes, range from: 32,768 to 32,767.v. int: 4 bytes, range from: 2^31 to 2^31-1.vi. long: 8 bytes, range from: 2^63 to 2^63-1.vii. float: 4 bytes, floating-point numbers with 6-7 decimal digits.viii. double: 8 bytes, floating-point numbers with 15 decimal digits.‚óæNon-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:Non-primitive data types refer to objects or arrays that are created by the programmer.

Nujat-E- HasnatNujat-E- Hasnat,,"‚óæIn Java, data types are classified into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (reference) data types.‚óæPrimitive Data Types:Primitive data types are the most basic data types in Java. They are predefined by the language and are used to store simple values.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store actual values.ii. Do not have methods or properties.iii. Fixed size and fast access.iv. Stored in memory directly (stack).‚óæ8 Primitive Data Types:i. boolean: Represents true or false.ii. char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.iii. byte: 1 byte, range from: 128 to 127.iv. short: 2 bytes, range from: 32,768 to 32,767.v. int: 4 bytes, range from: 2^31 to 2^31-1.vi. long: 8 bytes, range from: 2^63 to 2^63-1.vii. float: 4 bytes, floating-point numbers with 6-7 decimal digits.viii. double: 8 bytes, floating-point numbers with 15 decimal digits.‚óæNon-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:Non-primitive data types refer to objects or arrays that are created by the programmer. They store references (memory addresses) to the data rather than the actual data.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store references to objects.ii  Can have methods and properties.iii. Stored in heap memory.iv. Default value is null.‚óæExamples of Non-Primitive Data Types:i. Classes: User-defined types such as String, ArrayList, etc.ii  Interfaces: Defines methods that classes must implement.iii.

Nujat-E- HasnatNujat-E- Hasnat,,"‚óæIn Java, data types are classified into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (reference) data types.‚óæPrimitive Data Types:Primitive data types are the most basic data types in Java. They are predefined by the language and are used to store simple values.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store actual values.ii. Do not have methods or properties.iii. Fixed size and fast access.iv. Stored in memory directly (stack).‚óæ8 Primitive Data Types:i. boolean: Represents true or false.ii. char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.iii. byte: 1 byte, range from: 128 to 127.iv. short: 2 bytes, range from: 32,768 to 32,767.v. int: 4 bytes, range from: 2^31 to 2^31-1.vi. long: 8 bytes, range from: 2^63 to 2^63-1.vii. float: 4 bytes, floating-point numbers with 6-7 decimal digits.viii. double: 8 bytes, floating-point numbers with 15 decimal digits.‚óæNon-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:Non-primitive data types refer to objects or arrays that are created by the programmer. They store references (memory addresses) to the data rather than the actual data.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store references to objects.ii  Can have methods and properties.iii. Stored in heap memory.iv. Default value is null.‚óæExamples of Non-Primitive Data Types:i. Classes: User-defined types such as String, ArrayList, etc.ii  Interfaces: Defines methods that classes must implement.iii.

Nujat-E- HasnatNujat-E- Hasnat,,"‚óæIn Java, data types are classified into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (reference) data types.‚óæPrimitive Data Types:Primitive data types are the most basic data types in Java. They are predefined by the language and are used to store simple values.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store actual values.ii. Do not have methods or properties.iii. Fixed size and fast access.iv. Stored in memory directly (stack).‚óæ8 Primitive Data Types:i. boolean: Represents true or false.ii. char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.iii. byte: 1 byte, range from: 128 to 127.iv. short: 2 bytes, range from: 32,768 to 32,767.v. int: 4 bytes, range from: 2^31 to 2^31-1.vi. long: 8 bytes, range from: 2^63 to 2^63-1.vii. float: 4 bytes, floating-point numbers with 6-7 decimal digits.viii. double: 8 bytes, floating-point numbers with 15 decimal digits.‚óæNon-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:Non-primitive data types refer to objects or arrays that are created by the programmer. They store references (memory addresses) to the data rather than the actual data.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store references to objects.ii  Can have methods and properties.iii. Stored in heap memory.iv. Default value is null.‚óæExamples of Non-Primitive Data Types:i. Classes: User-defined types such as String, ArrayList, etc.ii  Interfaces: Defines methods that classes must implement.iii.

Nujat-E- HasnatNujat-E- Hasnat,,"‚óæIn Java, data types are classified into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (reference) data types.‚óæPrimitive Data Types:Primitive data types are the most basic data types in Java. They are predefined by the language and are used to store simple values.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store actual values.ii. Do not have methods or properties.iii. Fixed size and fast access.iv. Stored in memory directly (stack).‚óæ8 Primitive Data Types:i. boolean: Represents true or false.ii. char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.iii. byte: 1 byte, range from: 128 to 127.iv. short: 2 bytes, range from: 32,768 to 32,767.v. int: 4 bytes, range from: 2^31 to 2^31-1.vi. long: 8 bytes, range from: 2^63 to 2^63-1.vii. float: 4 bytes, floating-point numbers with 6-7 decimal digits.viii. double: 8 bytes, floating-point numbers with 15 decimal digits.‚óæNon-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:Non-primitive data types refer to objects or arrays that are created by the programmer. They store references (memory addresses) to the data rather than the actual data.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store references to objects.ii  Can have methods and properties.iii. Stored in heap memory.iv. Default value is null.‚óæExamples of Non-Primitive Data Types:i. Classes: User-defined types such as String, ArrayList, etc.ii  Interfaces: Defines methods that classes must implement.iii.

Nujat-E- HasnatNujat-E- Hasnat,,"‚óæIn Java, data types are classified into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (reference) data types.‚óæPrimitive Data Types:Primitive data types are the most basic data types in Java. They are predefined by the language and are used to store simple values.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store actual values.ii. Do not have methods or properties.iii. Fixed size and fast access.iv. Stored in memory directly (stack).‚óæ8 Primitive Data Types:i. boolean: Represents true or false.ii. char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.iii. byte: 1 byte, range from: 128 to 127.iv. short: 2 bytes, range from: 32,768 to 32,767.v. int: 4 bytes, range from: 2^31 to 2^31-1.vi. long: 8 bytes, range from: 2^63 to 2^63-1.vii. float: 4 bytes, floating-point numbers with 6-7 decimal digits.viii. double: 8 bytes, floating-point numbers with 15 decimal digits.‚óæNon-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:Non-primitive data types refer to objects or arrays that are created by the programmer. They store references (memory addresses) to the data rather than the actual data.‚óæCharacteristics:i. Store references to objects.ii  Can have methods and properties.iii. Stored in heap memory.iv. Default value is null.‚óæExamples of Non-Primitive Data Types:i. Classes: User-defined types such as String, ArrayList, etc.ii  Interfaces: Defines methods that classes must implement.iii.
