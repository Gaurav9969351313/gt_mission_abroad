Dorina PojaniDorina Pojani,,"Working from home isn’t a fad — it’s a fundamental shift in how we live and work. And it comes with substantial economic upsides. In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked.

In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics.

In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked.

Stored in memory directly (stack).◾8 Primitive Data Types:i. boolean: Represents true or false.ii. char: 2 bytes, stores a single Unicode character.iii. byte: 1 byte, range from: 128 to 127.iv. short: 2 bytes, range from: 32,768 to 32,767.v. int: 4 bytes, range from: 2^31 to 2^31-1.vi. long: 8 bytes, range from: 2^63 to 2^63-1.vii. float: 4 bytes, floating-point numbers with 6-7 decimal digits.viii. double: 8 bytes, floating-point numbers with 15 decimal digits.◾Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:Non-primitive data types refer to objects or arrays that are created by the programmer.

Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics.

Dorina PojaniDorina Pojani,,"Working from home isn’t a fad — it’s a fundamental shift in how we live and work. And it comes with substantial economic upsides. In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked. The research will be published in a new book in this series, edited by Jan Anne Annema: https://lnkd.in/dg6hrA7Y.

In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked.

Dorina PojaniDorina Pojani,,"Working from home isn’t a fad — it’s a fundamental shift in how we live and work. And it comes with substantial economic upsides. In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked.

Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics.

Dorina PojaniDorina Pojani,,"Working from home isn’t a fad — it’s a fundamental shift in how we live and work. And it comes with substantial economic upsides. In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked. The research will be published in a new book in this series, edited by Jan Anne Annema: https://lnkd.in/dg6hrA7Y.

In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics.

In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics.

In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked.

Dorina PojaniDorina Pojani,,"Working from home isn’t a fad — it’s a fundamental shift in how we live and work. And it comes with substantial economic upsides. In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked.

Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics.

Dorina PojaniDorina Pojani,,"Working from home isn’t a fad — it’s a fundamental shift in how we live and work. And it comes with substantial economic upsides. In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked. The research will be published in a new book in this series, edited by Jan Anne Annema: https://lnkd.in/dg6hrA7Y.

In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics.

In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics.

Dorina PojaniDorina Pojani,,"Working from home isn’t a fad — it’s a fundamental shift in how we live and work. And it comes with substantial economic upsides. In our latest piece for The Conversation Australia + NZ, Ying Lu, Neil Sipe, and I show that remote work offers tangible financial benefits for employers and society. Lower office expenses, less commuting, increased productivity, and even public health gains — the case stacks up well beyond lifestyle preferences or politics. We use secondary and proxy data for Brisbane at the height of the pandemic, when WFH peaked.
