That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team?

That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team?

That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team?

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal.

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results?

That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results?

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results?

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team?

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team?

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results?

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results?

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results?

Akshay SakhalkarAkshay Sakhalkar,,"In B2B sales, timing is everythingThe best conversations start when your prospect is already in motion. That’s where Sales Triggers come in.If you’re in IT Services, Product Engineering, or IT Staffing, you can’t afford to wait for RFPs to land in your inbox.You need to act before vendor evaluations begin.That’s how smart teams earn the right conversation at the right moment.After years of working with IT services and staffing teams, here are the Sales Triggers top-performing teams track:🔵 Primary Triggers- Leadership changes- New funding or M&A- RFPs / RFIs- GenAI adoption or tech modernization- Job postings for niche roles- Layoffs + active projects🟠 Secondary Triggers- Tech stack migration- Budget season- Regulatory or compliance pressure- Product launch or market expansionHere's a visual snapshot we often use internally to guide outreach:💡 A Trigger ≠ A Closed DealJust because you spotted a trigger and sent a message… Doesn’t mean you’ll win the deal. You still need:- A compelling value proposition- Right ICP match- Context on their goals- Trusted follow-upIt’s like seeing someone pack for vacation — you still don’t know where they’re going or if they need your help.Instead of saying “Can we connect?”, say:“I noticed your product team is hiring in DevOps and just announced a GenAI initiative. Would it help to explore a lean offshore pod to scale faster? We’ve done this for similar teams — happy to share how.”🎯 Trigger-based selling isn’t just smart — it’s respectful. You’re showing up with relevance, not noise.Let’s Talk: Are you using any unusual or effective trigger points with your team? Drop them in the comments — let’s swap ideas.🛠️ Running trigger-based outreach but not seeing results? Let’s review what’s missing in your Trigger → Outreach → Conversion playbook.📩 Drop a 🔥 or DM me for a quick 1:1 teardown.hashtag#B2BSales hashtag#ITStaffing hashtag#ProductEngineering hashtag#SalesTriggers hashtag#SmartOutreach hashtag#GTMStrategy hashtag#SalesPlaybook hashtag#ABM hashtag#LeadGen hashtag#SalesExecution
