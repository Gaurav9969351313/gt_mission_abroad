Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?

Egor UrvanovEgor Urvanov,,"Google Research выкатили CURIE — бенчмарк, который показывает, как LLM на самом деле справляются с научными задачами. Спойлер: слабо.CURIE — это 10 реальных задач из 6 научных доменов (материалы, квант, гео, био, протеины и т.д.), где надо понимать длиннющий текст (15k слов), вытаскивать сложную инфу, логически её связывать и оформлять нормально. Ни один текущий LLM не вытянул всё уверенно. Особенно заваливаются на задачах с агрегацией и структурным извлечением данных.Дальше SPIQA — 270 тысяч QA по таблицам и графикам из научных статей. Тут проверяется мультимодальность. Даже лучшие open-source модели начали что-то показывать только после обучения на SPIQA.А потом — FEABench. Тут вообще другой уровень: надо понять инженерную задачу и с помощью языка управлять COMSOL — симулятором физических процессов. Результат? Ноль. Ни одна модель не справилась до конца.Выводы простые:- LLM ещё не готовы к серьёзной науке.- Но теперь хотя бы есть честные бенчмарки, чтобы это доказать.CURIE, SPIQA и FEABench — must-have, если делаешь ИИ-ассистента для ресерча.- Open-source можно тянуть вверх, если правильно обучать.Всё будет, но пока без человека никак.- Если вы в теме — гляньте CURIE, это не игрушка, это реальный тест для ""интеллекта"".Гитхаб: https://lnkd.in/gfsnn8V2Source: https://lnkd.in/gfnE8TzA——————Менеджер?
