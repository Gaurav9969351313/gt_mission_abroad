You don’t expect a report — just get it done.Action<string> sayHi = name => Console.WriteLine($""Hi, {name}!"");sayHi(""Benito"");🧼 It performs a task but returns nothing (void).🔍 Func — “Do something and give me a result”Like hiring someone to calculate your taxes. You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You don’t expect a report — just get it done.Action<string> sayHi = name => Console.WriteLine($""Hi, {name}!"");sayHi(""Benito"");🧼 It performs a task but returns nothing (void).🔍 Func — “Do something and give me a result”Like hiring someone to calculate your taxes. You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You don’t expect a report — just get it done.Action<string> sayHi = name => Console.WriteLine($""Hi, {name}!"");sayHi(""Benito"");🧼 It performs a task but returns nothing (void).🔍 Func — “Do something and give me a result”Like hiring someone to calculate your taxes. You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering

You give them info, they give you a number.Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) => a + b;int sum = add(3, 5); 📦 It always returns a value  the last generic type is the return type.✅ Predicate — “Check a condition and return true/false”Like asking: “Is this email spam?” You get a yes/no answer — that’s it.Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;bool result = isEven(4); // true✅ It always returns a bool.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#Func hashtag#Action hashtag#Predicate hashtag#Delegates hashtag#DevTips hashtag#SoftwareEngineering
