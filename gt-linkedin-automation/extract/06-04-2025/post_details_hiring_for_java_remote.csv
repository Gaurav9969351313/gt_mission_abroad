The link on this post is a direct referral from me, so please apply and let me know if you've applied in the comments! Also, share with your network to help someone who might be a good fit land their next role.You are a good fit if you:- Have deep expertise in one or more of the following languages: Rust, Ruby, Go, C++, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Python, C- Have 5+ years of industry experience working directly with one of the above languages- Or, you have comparably large-scale contributions to complex open-source projects - Are available for a minimum of 10 hours per weekMy favorite part about applying with Mercor is that I didn't have to deal with recruiters who had zero understanding of my technical knowledge and background. All it involves is a resume upload and a 30-minute interview with an AI interviewer. This role is also awesome in that it's fully asynchronous and remote, which means you can work when it works best for you.

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

The link on this post is a direct referral from me, so please apply and let me know if you've applied in the comments! Also, share with your network to help someone who might be a good fit land their next role.You are a good fit if you:- Have deep expertise in one or more of the following languages: Rust, Ruby, Go, C++, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Python, C- Have 5+ years of industry experience working directly with one of the above languages- Or, you have comparably large-scale contributions to complex open-source projects - Are available for a minimum of 10 hours per weekMy favorite part about applying with Mercor is that I didn't have to deal with recruiters who had zero understanding of my technical knowledge and background. All it involves is a resume upload and a 30-minute interview with an AI interviewer. This role is also awesome in that it's fully asynchronous and remote, which means you can work when it works best for you.

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

The link on this post is a direct referral from me, so please apply and let me know if you've applied in the comments! Also, share with your network to help someone who might be a good fit land their next role.You are a good fit if you:- Have deep expertise in one or more of the following languages: Rust, Ruby, Go, C++, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Python, C- Have 5+ years of industry experience working directly with one of the above languages- Or, you have comparably large-scale contributions to complex open-source projects - Are available for a minimum of 10 hours per weekMy favorite part about applying with Mercor is that I didn't have to deal with recruiters who had zero understanding of my technical knowledge and background. All it involves is a resume upload and a 30-minute interview with an AI interviewer. This role is also awesome in that it's fully asynchronous and remote, which means you can work when it works best for you.

Miriam MouradMiriam Mourad,,"This week, I finally met some of the people I’ve worked with for the past 3 years, in person.And it felt like I’ve known them forever.That’s the magic of globally distributed teams.It reminded me of when I went to an international boarding school at 18.Fifteen months. Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

The link on this post is a direct referral from me, so please apply and let me know if you've applied in the comments! Also, share with your network to help someone who might be a good fit land their next role.You are a good fit if you:- Have deep expertise in one or more of the following languages: Rust, Ruby, Go, C++, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Python, C- Have 5+ years of industry experience working directly with one of the above languages- Or, you have comparably large-scale contributions to complex open-source projects - Are available for a minimum of 10 hours per weekMy favorite part about applying with Mercor is that I didn't have to deal with recruiters who had zero understanding of my technical knowledge and background. All it involves is a resume upload and a 30-minute interview with an AI interviewer. This role is also awesome in that it's fully asynchronous and remote, which means you can work when it works best for you.

Miriam MouradMiriam Mourad,,"This week, I finally met some of the people I’ve worked with for the past 3 years, in person.And it felt like I’ve known them forever.That’s the magic of globally distributed teams.It reminded me of when I went to an international boarding school at 18.Fifteen months. Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

The link on this post is a direct referral from me, so please apply and let me know if you've applied in the comments!

Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work

The link on this post is a direct referral from me, so please apply and let me know if you've applied in the comments! Also, share with your network to help someone who might be a good fit land their next role.You are a good fit if you:- Have deep expertise in one or more of the following languages: Rust, Ruby, Go, C++, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Python, C- Have 5+ years of industry experience working directly with one of the above languages- Or, you have comparably large-scale contributions to complex open-source projects - Are available for a minimum of 10 hours per weekMy favorite part about applying with Mercor is that I didn't have to deal with recruiters who had zero understanding of my technical knowledge and background.

Miriam MouradMiriam Mourad,,"This week, I finally met some of the people I’ve worked with for the past 3 years, in person.And it felt like I’ve known them forever.That’s the magic of globally distributed teams.It reminded me of when I went to an international boarding school at 18.Fifteen months. Friends from everywhere.I thought I’d never experience that again when I left.But remote work gave it back to me.We’d meet up in random European cities over the years, and the connection was still there.Now, with people I work with, it felt exactly the same.Different countries.Different time zones.Same bond.Working globally doesn’t just unlock opportunity.It builds community.It creates friendships that stretch across borders.This is the human side of global work.And it’s powerful.Have you had this kind of experience through remote work?♻️ Repost to share with your network💓 Follow me for more about remote work
