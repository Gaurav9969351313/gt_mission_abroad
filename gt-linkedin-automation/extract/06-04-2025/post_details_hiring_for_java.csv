Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""
