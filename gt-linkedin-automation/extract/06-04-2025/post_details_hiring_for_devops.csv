Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network.

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Suyash Gupta 💡Suyash Gupta 💡,,"Day 6🚀 The Resume Mistakes That Are Costing You Your Dream Job!So, you spent years learning to code, grinding Leetcode, and acing DSA… but your job applications are still getting ghosted? 👻Chances are, your resume is the problem (not you, my friend). Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume. Make every word count! 🚀💬 Drop your resume in the comments if you want a quick review!

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Təsəvvür et:– Oracle SQL bilirsən,– PL/SQL ilə sistem qurursan,– APEX ilə interfeysləri düzəldirsən,– Sistemi sazlayırsan,– Support verirsən,– Test edirsən,– Kredit məhsullarını da bilirsən…və bütün bunlar 2 il təcrübə ilə!Qardaş, bu 2 il NASA-da keçibsə, bəlkə mümkündür.Üstəlik ""stressə davamlılıq"" da vacibdir – çünki bu qədər işi bir adama verəndə davam gətirməsən, tətbiqi sistemlər deyil, namizəd çökür.Bəzən elə gəlir ki, vakansiya yox, Marvel üçün superqəhrəman kastinqidir.Əziz HR dostlar, biz developerik, transformer yox.

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Suyash Gupta 💡Suyash Gupta 💡,,"Day 6🚀 The Resume Mistakes That Are Costing You Your Dream Job!So, you spent years learning to code, grinding Leetcode, and acing DSA… but your job applications are still getting ghosted? 👻Chances are, your resume is the problem (not you, my friend). Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume. Make every word count! 🚀💬 Drop your resume in the comments if you want a quick review!

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific.

""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Suyash Gupta 💡Suyash Gupta 💡,,"Day 6🚀 The Resume Mistakes That Are Costing You Your Dream Job!So, you spent years learning to code, grinding Leetcode, and acing DSA… but your job applications are still getting ghosted? 👻Chances are, your resume is the problem (not you, my friend). Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume. Make every word count! 🚀💬 Drop your resume in the comments if you want a quick review!

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters!

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Suyash Gupta 💡Suyash Gupta 💡,,"Day 6🚀 The Resume Mistakes That Are Costing You Your Dream Job!So, you spent years learning to code, grinding Leetcode, and acing DSA… but your job applications are still getting ghosted? 👻Chances are, your resume is the problem (not you, my friend). Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume. Make every word count! 🚀💬 Drop your resume in the comments if you want a quick review!

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset.

One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume.

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

Eitan PelesEitan Peles,,"⏰ Mastering CRON Scheduling in Jenkins and CI/CD PipelinesAutomating builds, tests, and deployments efficiently is crucial in modern DevOps workflows. One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated.""

For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership

One powerful tool for achieving this is CRON scheduling.In Jenkins (and many other CI/CD tools), CRON lets you define precise schedules for automated tasks using a simple syntax:```* * * * *|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  | +--- Day of the week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)|  |  | +----- Month (1-12)|  | +------- Day of the month (1-31)| +--------- Hour (0-23)+----------- Minute (0-59)```Examples:- Every minute: `* * * * *`- Every day at midnight: `0 0 * * *`- Every Sunday at 3 AM: `0 3 * * 0`Using CRON effectively ensures your CI/CD pipelines run precisely when needed, optimizing resource utilization and keeping your software delivery process smooth and predictable.hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Jenkins hashtag#CICD hashtag#Automation hashtag#CRON hashtag#ContinuousIntegration hashtag#ContinuousDelivery

Suyash Gupta 💡Suyash Gupta 💡,,"Day 6🚀 The Resume Mistakes That Are Costing You Your Dream Job!So, you spent years learning to code, grinding Leetcode, and acing DSA… but your job applications are still getting ghosted? 👻Chances are, your resume is the problem (not you, my friend). Here are 3 common mistakes every engineer makes and how to fix them:🔴 1. ""Engineer | C | C++ | Java | Python | JavaScript | React | AWS | AI | ML | Blockchain | Web3 | DevOps | Cybersecurity | Game Dev | IoT | Cloud""Bro, are you a software engineer or the entire tech industry? 😂Fix: Focus on 3-4 relevant skills, not every buzzword in existence.🔴 2. ""Worked on multiple projects using various technologies.""Bhai, koi details toh de do!Fix: Be specific. Instead, write:""Built a hospital management system using MERN stack, handling 500+ patient requests daily.""🔴 3. ""Responsible for coding and testing software.""That’s like saying ""I drink water to stay hydrated."" Not helping!Fix: Use action words:""Developed an automated testing framework, reducing bug reports by 30%.""📌 Pro Tip: Recruiters spend less than 6 seconds scanning your resume. Make every word count! 🚀💬 Drop your resume in the comments if you want a quick review!

Sony Harshitha AvulaSony Harshitha Avula,,"Navigating the 2025 Job Market: A Challenging Reality for Job Seekers 💼🔍The job market in 2025 is more competitive than ever, with tightening hiring processes, automation reshaping industries, and companies focusing on cost-efficiency. For those seeking jobs, this means fewer job postings, evolving skill demands, and an increasing reliance on AI 🤖. With the U.S. unemployment rate at 4.2% and AI-driven automation affecting 60% of jobs, it’s clear that the struggle is real.Reflecting on my own journey:💠 I started my job search in August 2024, and it took me almost two weeks just to perfect my resume! Even when I thought I was done, I kept refining it 📄🔄.💠No one was around to guide me on how to apply for jobs, but Pritesh Jagani 's videos became my lifesaver. I tuned into his several podcasts 🎧 to understand how to market myself effectively.💠I can't do mass applications. An application almost takes an hour for me, first finding the right job application, then tailoring resume, asking for referral, applying, and then reaching out to recruiters. This way I find that I got better results. It's all about quality over quantity ✅.💠Reaching out to over 1000 employees on LinkedIn, I only received responses from 10 to 15 people agreeing to refer 🤝. I've applied to 300+ jobs so far. Received several emails from companies saying that the position has been filled, or has been closed. I gave a few screening rounds, and final rounds too. Every interview resulted in rejection. Disappointing, but every rejection has been a learning experience 💪. In parallel, I’ve been developing my skills, building projects 🛠️, and growing my network 🌐. While the road is tough, I’ve gained valuable insights from this journey. Here are my key takeaways:🔑 Just submitting your resume online isn’t enough—always apply via a referral 💡.🔑 Reach out to recruiters! Express why you’re a great fit for the role, show your enthusiasm for the company, and demonstrate your research on the organization 📚.🔑 Tap into your alumni network. Finding alumni from your program and requesting a brief virtual chat can unlock hidden job opportunities and expand your connections 👥.With expertise in full-stack development, AI-driven solutions, and cloud technologies, I am proficient in JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, Python, MongoDB, and DevOps tools such as Jenkins and Docker. 💻🚀 I am continuously expanding my skill set and am open to new opportunities where I can contribute to innovative projects and further advance my career. 📈 I am currently seeking a position where I can apply my skills and experience. If you have any relevant opportunities, feel free to reach out to me—I’d be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team. 🤝hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#AI hashtag#JavaScript hashtag#ReactJS hashtag#NodeJS hashtag#Python hashtag#DevOps hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Venu MuvvaVenu Muvva,,"Is Bangalore’s IT Sector Ready for Trump’s New Tariff World?Over the past few weeks, Trump’s re-election bid has reignited his tariff-first doctrine—this time with a clearer structure: green, yellow, red buckets for trade partners. India likely sits in the “yellow” zone—strategic, but not untouchable.While the tariffs are primarily aimed at goods, the ripple effect on the U.S. economy and client behaviors will directly impact India’s $280B IT industry—especially in Bangalore, the tech capital of the world.So let’s talk real numbers and ground realities for Bangalore’s IT ecosystem:⸻Short-Term Impact (2024-2025): •	Client Anxiety = Project SlowdownsWith inflationary fears rising in the U.S. due to tariffs, clients are delaying discretionary IT spends.→ Project closures are down by 1.3% QoQ.→ Bench strength has increased by 15% in Tier 1 IT firms. •	Hiring Freeze LightHiring across software services and product-based companies is down by 22% YoY in Bangalore since Jan 2024. Lateral hiring is particularly slow. •	Revenue Dips in BFSI and RetailU.S.-based clients from banking and retail—major verticals for Indian IT—are cutting back budgets by 8–10% as per early FY25 trends.⸻Long-Term Outlook (2025-2030): •	Opportunity in U.S. Re-shoringAs U.S. firms diversify away from China/Vietnam, India can absorb that business—if it aligns its manufacturing + IT policy.→ Expect up to 3 million new tech-manufacturing crossover jobs by 2030. •	New Skilling DemandsDemand for AI, DevOps, Cybersecurity and Cloud Infra experts will surge. Bangalore must build a new tech workforce, not just more headcount. •	Strategic Green Zone?If India navigates diplomacy well, it could move into the “green bucket” of U.S. trade—with tariff relief and investment access.→ That could unlock $100B+ in bilateral digital infrastructure flows in the next 5 years.⸻The Big Picture:Yes, Trump’s tariff chaos looks messy. But behind it is a well-orchestrated global reset. If India positions itself wisely, Bangalore could emerge as the strategic tech capital in a new U.S.-aligned global order.But it will take policy agility, economic diplomacy, and workforce transformation—not business as usual.⸻Is Bangalore ready for the MAGA global reset? hashtag#BangaloreTech hashtag#TrumpTariffs hashtag#GlobalTrade hashtag#IndianIT hashtag#BangaloreJobs hashtag#DigitalIndia hashtag#TariffImpact hashtag#MakeInIndia hashtag#TechDiplomacy hashtag#GlobalEconomy hashtag#EmergingMarkets hashtag#AIJobs hashtag#USIndiaRelations hashtag#Geopolitics hashtag#SoftwareJobs hashtag#Workforce2025 hashtag#MAGAPlan hashtag#Infrastructure hashtag#JobMarket hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LinkedInNews hashtag#IndiaTechLeadership
