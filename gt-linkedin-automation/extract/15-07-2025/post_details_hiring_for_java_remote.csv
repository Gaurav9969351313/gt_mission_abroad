This isn’t just a job for me, it’s what I love doing.Professionally, I’ve led engineering efforts on mission-critical systems for the Air Force, built full-stack apps in Java, Spring Boot, React, GraphQL, Kafka, and AWS. I’ve also led teams — both as a software lead and as a squad leader in the Army — and have mentored students while lecturing.I'm a self-starter, I learn fast, and while I may not be the best at interviews, if you want results and iteration, I will deliver every time.
