It tells what a class must do, but not how to do it.✅ Helps achieve abstraction ✅ Supports multiple inheritance in Java ✅ Improves loose coupling between componentsReal-world example: Think of an interface as a remote control. Different brands of TVs implement the same basic functions—power on/off, volume control—but how they work internally is different.hashtag#Java hashtag#JavaInterface hashtag#InterfaceInJava hashtag#JavaConcepts hashtag#LearnJava hashtag#JavaLearning hashtag#CodingCommunity hashtag#JavaDeveloper hashtag#BackendDevelopment hashtag#SpringBoot hashtag#Microservices hashtag#TechTalk hashtag#TechCommunity hashtag#ProgrammersLife hashtag#CodeNewbie hashtag#WomenWhoCode hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#100DaysOfCode hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#ObjectOrientedProgramming hashtag#JavaBackend hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#API hashtag#DesignPatterns
