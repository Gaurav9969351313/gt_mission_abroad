While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung?

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day.

Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”.

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

I’ve developed and maintained scalable ELT workflows, integrated structured and semi-structured data from multiple sources, and supported real-time and batch data processing use cases.One of my core strengths lies in large-scale data migrations and modernizing legacy systems to the cloud. I’ve led efforts in conceptual, logical, and physical data modeling, ensuring data quality, performance, and governance through CI/CD and reusable frameworks.I have domain experience in healthcare, banking, and financial services, where I worked closely with cross-functional teams to develop analytical datasets that drive business decisions and predictive models. For example, in a recent healthcare project, I automated the ingestion and transformation of EMR data using Databricks notebooks and improved data availability by 60%.In addition to my technical skills, I’m confident working in agile environments with global delivery teams, and I prioritize clear communication and documentation. I’m also comfortable with Unix shell scripting, version control via Git, and I hold a Databricks/AWS/SNOWFLAKE  Certified Data Engineer Associate certification.

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Mohammad F.Mohammad F.,,"He made the jump from Samsung India (13.5 LPA) to Google (50 LPA) within just 2 years of graduating and cracked 4 offers from (Amazon, Google, ION Trading, Lime Road) in the worst job market possible. While companies have been laying off people consistently, what magic did Vaibhav did to get 4 offers in 2024 and that too while working full time at Samsung? Here's his strategy: (DSA + Time Management + Overall Job Hunting Mindset) ➧ Never stopped DSA, no matter what.→ Started with just C in college, then moved to C++ and DSA by second year.→ Solved 900+ DSA questions in college. Crossed 1,500 before landing Google.→ Didn’t try to do everything: stuck to LeetCode, Codeforces, and GFG. No jumping to every new platform.→ Built a daily habit. Even during the toughest office days, DSA didn’t stop.--Also, If you’re learning DSA currently, enrollments in my DSA cohort are still open.- added access to LLD module- community of 100s of students- 5 exclusive sessions with FAANG recruiters & engineersCheck it out here:https://lnkd.in/gJQZWGeh--➧ Job + Preparation: Managed Both (even with a 3.5-hour daily commute!)→ Samsung office shift: 8.5 hours/day. Commute: 3.5 hours/day. Still made time.→ After reaching home at 7pm, took a break, then sat down at 8:30pm every night, 2 hours for DSA, 30-45 min for job applications.→ Saturday/Sunday: 4-5 hours straight for DSA, system design, and interview prep. Treated weekends as “bonus time” for deep focus.➧ Didn’t just send 10 resumes and chill, Applied Everywhere (with a system)→ Applied to more than 2,000 jobs in 1–1.5 years. For Amazon, Microsoft, Adobe: 30-40 times each.→ Used Naukri, LinkedIn (sorted by “recent jobs”), and company career pages directly.→ Kept Naukri profile “active” by making small updates daily, this actually increased HR calls.→ Bought LinkedIn Premium, used “actively hiring” filter, messaged HRs with a direct note (job ID + resume + why he fits).➧ Referrals are not magic, Direct Applications Worked→ Out of all his offers, referrals only got him a Google interview. For the rest, direct application did the job.→ For referrals, sent short, direct messages to employees: “Here’s my background, here’s the job, here’s why I fit.”→ No spamming; targeted each message to the right person.➧ Resume: Only What Matters, No “Gyaan”→ For freshers: Projects should be unique, not just “Netflix Clone”. Wrote exactly what he built, not a copied template.→ For experienced: Wrote clear numbers (“improved speed by X%”), not just feature lists.→ Made resume on Overleaf (LaTeX) for clean, ATS-friendly formatting.Continued in Comments ↡

Dev Raj SainiDev Raj Saini,,"Ever applied to 50 jobs and never heard back? You're not alone.  I receive 200+ DMs every month from people saying: > “Any real WFH openings, sir?” > “I’ve done 3 courses — still not getting responses.” > “The job market feels... hopeless.”  The truth? There’s no shortage of talent. But there's definitely a shortage of trustworthy job platforms — especially for freshers and freelancers.  That’s why I believe Artha is something every creator, community builder, and career coach should know about. It’s not just another job board. It’s a platform that lets you build your own job board — under your brand, for your niche, with zero tech hassle and no upfront cost.  📌 What is Artha? It’s the job board engine powering the next wave of creator-owned career platforms — and yes, you can launch it for FREE. 🔹 For creators & communities: – Launch your own job board — with your name and branding – Zero coding required – Artha takes care of setup, hosting, design, and backend, even job listing so your job board is not blank – Free to launch — start without spending a single rupee  🔹 For your audience: – Discover curated, verified job opportunities (no spam or “pay to apply”) – Focused on remote, digital, and early-career roles – Skill-based filtering: design, dev, writing, cloud, marketing, and more – Simple, fast-apply interface your community will love  🔹 For founders & hiring teams: – Post jobs directly to your board — and pay you, not a third-party platform – Reach high-intent, pre-engaged audiences inside niche communities – No agency fees. No algorithm games. Just direct access 💸Artha allows you to earn in multiple ways:  – Affiliate Click Revenue → Earn when people click through to jobs – Paid Listings → Founders pay to feature roles in your community – Consulting & Add-ons → Resume reviews, mentorship, private support – Brand Equity → Build your own trusted career ecosystem  Many creators using Artha earn $500–$1,000/month by Month 4–6. Some go beyond $2,000 depending on niche + engagement.  It’s not just a tool — it’s a monetization model for the creator economy.  📌 Whether you're: ✅ Burnout with the algorithm game ✅ Building a career-focused community ✅ Or just need an better monetization tool…  Artha is worth exploring. 🔗 Link in first comment 👇  Let me know what you think — happy to answer questions!  hashtag#ArthaJobBoard hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RemoteJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#LinkedInIndia hashtag#DevRajSaini hashtag#freshers hashtag#job hashtag#MonetizeYourBrand hashtag#CreatorEconomy
