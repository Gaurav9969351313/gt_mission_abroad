Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Vishal TalawarVishal Talawar,,"Hey all,2 years ago, I began my journey into tech with no clear path—just curiosity, persistence, and a drive to build.Coming from an electrical engineering background, I had no clue what backend development was. I was completely new to coding, but I took the leap—and through trial, error, and constant learning, I’ve grown into a backend developer with hands-on experience in .NET, C#, scalable APIs, and clean architecture principles like SOLID.It’s been a journey filled with late nights, debugging challenges, and moments of self-doubt, but every step has made me stronger and more committed to continuous learning.🔍 I’m now actively looking to explore new opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and continue growing as a developer. If you’re hiring or know of roles that align with my background, I’d love to connect and have a conversation! 😄hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DotNet hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#KeepBuilding hashtag#Technology hashtag#Motivation

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

I was completely new to coding, but I took the leap—and through trial, error, and constant learning, I’ve grown into a backend developer with hands-on experience in .NET, C#, scalable APIs, and clean architecture principles like SOLID.It’s been a journey filled with late nights, debugging challenges, and moments of self-doubt, but every step has made me stronger and more committed to continuous learning.🔍 I’m now actively looking to explore new opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and continue growing as a developer.

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Vishal TalawarVishal Talawar,,"Hey all,2 years ago, I began my journey into tech with no clear path—just curiosity, persistence, and a drive to build.Coming from an electrical engineering background, I had no clue what backend development was. I was completely new to coding, but I took the leap—and through trial, error, and constant learning, I’ve grown into a backend developer with hands-on experience in .NET, C#, scalable APIs, and clean architecture principles like SOLID.It’s been a journey filled with late nights, debugging challenges, and moments of self-doubt, but every step has made me stronger and more committed to continuous learning.🔍 I’m now actively looking to explore new opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and continue growing as a developer.

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

Vishal TalawarVishal Talawar,,"Hey all,2 years ago, I began my journey into tech with no clear path—just curiosity, persistence, and a drive to build.Coming from an electrical engineering background, I had no clue what backend development was. I was completely new to coding, but I took the leap—and through trial, error, and constant learning, I’ve grown into a backend developer with hands-on experience in .NET, C#, scalable APIs, and clean architecture principles like SOLID.It’s been a journey filled with late nights, debugging challenges, and moments of self-doubt, but every step has made me stronger and more committed to continuous learning.🔍 I’m now actively looking to explore new opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and continue growing as a developer. If you’re hiring or know of roles that align with my background, I’d love to connect and have a conversation! 😄hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DotNet hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#KeepBuilding hashtag#Technology hashtag#Motivation

Whether you’re building interactive websites, robust backend systems, or scalable APIs, understanding the ecosystem is key.Here’s a breakdown of essential skills and technologies every aspiring web developer should know, as illustrated in this roadmap:1. Web Development OverviewWeb development broadly consists of Frontend and Backend development:Frontend (Client-side): Everything users see and interact with in the browser.Backend (Server-side): Logic, data storage, and APIs that power the frontend.2. Frontend DevelopmentLanguages to master:HTML – The backbone of web pages, defines structure and content.CSS – Responsible for styling and layout.JavaScript – Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.Popular Frameworks:React – A fast, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs.Vue.js – A progressive framework that’s easy to integrate.Angular – A full-featured framework for building large-scale apps.Helpful Libraries: jQuery – Simplifies DOM manipulation (less common now).Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework.Bootstrap – Predefined CSS & JS components for responsive designs.3. Backend DevelopmentLanguages to consider:Node.js (JavaScript) – Allows JS to run on the server.Python – Great for rapid development and clean code.PHP – Widely used for web servers and CMS platforms.Java – Enterprise-grade backend solutions.Databases: MySQL – A relational SQL database.MongoDB – A NoSQL, document-oriented database.PostgreSQL – Advanced SQL with powerful features.APIs: REST API – Most common architecture for communication between frontend and backend.GraphQL – A modern alternative to REST for more flexible queries.Why This Matters?This roadmap helps beginners and experienced developers alike to understand the landscape of web development. Whether you want to specialize in frontend, backend, or become a full-stack developer, these tools and technologies form the foundation of your journey.hashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#Microsoft hashtag#AspDotNetCore hashtag#WebApi hashtag#SqlServer hashtag#SoftWare hashtag#OpenToNetWork hashtag#BengaluruTech hashtag#Bengaluru hashtag#Fresher hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Linkedin hashtag#BackEndDeveloper hashtag#SwaggerUi hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#AdoDotNet hashtag#MicrosoftDeveloper

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering

I was completely new to coding, but I took the leap—and through trial, error, and constant learning, I’ve grown into a backend developer with hands-on experience in .NET, C#, scalable APIs, and clean architecture principles like SOLID.It’s been a journey filled with late nights, debugging challenges, and moments of self-doubt, but every step has made me stronger and more committed to continuous learning.🔍 I’m now actively looking to explore new opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and continue growing as a developer.

Adam ZivAdam Ziv,,"Over the past couple months, I’ve been building out the most technically demanding backend system I’ve ever worked on.It started as a way to get better at .NET and Entity Framework Core, but it’s turned into my personal engineering sandbox. Right now, it’s a modular monolith built with .NET 9, with 8 full modules: Auth, User, Address, Schedule, Service, Metrics, Recommendations, and a full stock prediction pipeline using ML.NET. Each module is structured independently, with its own DbContext, migrations, services, and logging.The ML pipeline processes over 619,000 stock records and currently hits 97.78% R² accuracy, with about 2.5% prediction error.I use this project to explore new concepts, then actually implement them in a realistic architecture. I’m currently working on adding Prometheus + Grafana for advanced metrics tracking. After that, I’m looking at Redis caching, integration testing, and real-time features.AI tools like ChatGPT have been a big part of how I’ve been able to move fast. I didn’t use them to copy-paste code. I used them to explain gaps in my understanding, validate architectural decisions, and keep momentum when I’d normally hit roadblocks.This isn’t a portfolio project meant to be “done.” It’s an ongoing space where I challenge myself to build like a real engineer, learn through iteration, and actually ship working systems.If you’re curious how it’s built, or you’re hiring and looking for someone who learns by doing, the repo’s here: https://lnkd.in/gDWihSsFAlways open to feedback, questions, or just connecting with others doing serious work.hashtag#dotnet hashtag#mlnet hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#ai hashtag#softwareengineering
