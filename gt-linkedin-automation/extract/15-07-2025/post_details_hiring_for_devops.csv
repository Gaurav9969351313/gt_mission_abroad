Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure.

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure.

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure.

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files.

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening

Harshavardhan NandigamaHarshavardhan Nandigama,,"Finally got the hang of Docker commands and built my first custom image—containers aren’t as wild as I thought! 🐳 My notes on Dockerfiles are my go-to now. I made an app image with AlmaLinux and Nginx, and I’m excited to join a DevOps team! Takeaways: - Run ""docker build -t image:tag"" to make custom images from a Dockerfile. - CMD kicks in when the container starts—don’t confuse it with ""RUN"". - Use ""docker inspect"" to troubleshoot container problems. - Stick with ""COPY"" for simple file transfers; ""ADD"" is extra unless you’re unzipping files. What’s your best Docker tip for newbies? I’m looking for entry-level DevOps roles—DMs open! hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Docker hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#hiring hashtag#aws hashtag#cloudcomputing

Vikash PatelVikash Patel,,"Today I was exploring cloud computing and felt like this is something worth sharing. Just imagine — no need to buy heavy hardware or worry about maintenance. Everything runs over the internet — storage, servers, even security — all on remote machines. And the best part? You only pay for what you use. Truly a game changer! What is Cloud Computing ⁉️ Earlier, we used to store our files in the computer system, but after some time, suppose there are many employees in our company, then in such a case, we will buy an SSD hard drive 💿 to store all their data or else. In case we bring a new system 💻, our hardware expenditure will increase, and the ⚡️electricity bill will also increase. A tech team will have to be appointed to manage all the hardware. If any hardware issue arises, then it will have to be managed on our own 🕺. In such a case, if the system which is not used will result in loss to the company, so for such a solution, if we had any such service which stores data for us and the work that we were doing on a local server, 🏠 local system, gets it done somewhere else on some 🧑‍💻remote machine in a remote system, someone else is looking after all the money management of its tech team, power, tech team, hardware team. In return for using all this, we pay them a nominal charge, and when we ask for the service, then we use it, and when it stops working, then we stop it. If you use less or more as per your requirement, in such cases, all these cases are provided by cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) Azure, Google Cloud, etc. In this, we get on-demand services like the pay-as-you-go model, the less service I use, the less I charge; the more I use, the more I charge; rest all maintenance, security, fast team, power, all these cases are being managed by the cloud provider.Similarly, if we are coders or from the tech industry, if we code, then we will  have to download all the software, and also their speed will depend on the hardware. In such a case, if you are giving an interview for interview placement, then whether your code runs in your system or not depends on our system, but in the same case, if we are doing cloud computing by hiring a server, then for that, we just need to have a good-speed internet. So this kind of model is called cloud computing.hashtag#cloud hashtag#90DaysOfDevOps hashtag#LinuxAdmin hashtag#DevOps hashtag#AWS Shubham Londhe Anshuman patel Vikash Patel

Sai Venkat P.Sai Venkat P.,,"Day 6/100: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Interview Prep Series – Aiming for 100k Connections on LinkedIn hashtag#season443,740 connections / 1,00,000 🎯Day 6 of my 100-day AWS interview challenge is here! Every day, I’m sharing one real AWS interview question, a detailed explanation, and a resource to help you build strong AWS knowledge.Today’s Question: Explain the process of rolling back a failed deployment in AWS.Key Points: Rolling back a failed deployment in AWS is an essential skill for any cloud engineer or operations professional. Deployments can fail due to misconfigurations, bugs, or unexpected runtime issues. The rollback process ensures that you can quickly revert to a stable version, minimizing downtime and impact.1. Identify Failure: Continuously monitor your deployment pipeline and production environment to detect failures early. Use AWS services like CloudWatch Logs, AWS CodeDeploy, or third-party monitoring tools to pinpoint where and why the failure occurred.2. Stop Deployment: As soon as an issue is detected, halt any further deployment steps to prevent additional changes from being applied. This prevents cascading failures and helps isolate the root cause.3. Investigate Cause: Review logs, metrics, and error messages to diagnose the problem accurately. Understanding the root cause is critical before you roll back to ensure you don’t repeat the same issue.4. Rollback Plan: Prepare a clear plan to revert the changes. If you use AWS CodeDeploy, you can automate rollbacks to the last known good revision. If you’re using infrastructure as code with CloudFormation, you can use stack rollback features to revert resources to their previous state.5. Execute Rollback: Implement the rollback plan by redeploying the last stable version of your application, configuration, or infrastructure. Automation tools and version-controlled deployments make this safer and faster.6. Verify: After rollback, test thoroughly to confirm that the system is stable and functioning as expected. Validate logs, metrics, and user experience.7. Communicate: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the rollback process. Clear updates help maintain trust and coordination within the team.8. Learn and Improve: Once resolved, conduct a post-mortem analysis to document what went wrong, what worked during rollback, and how to prevent similar failures in future deployments.Resource for the Day: Learn how AWS CodeDeploy handles rollbacks: https://lnkd.in/gwcxgx_FFeel free to share this post with your network or tag someone who might be interested!♻️ Share this now ———Follow me for more Cloud opportunities and resources, Sai Venkat P. hashtag#InnovateAndGrow hashtag#IndiaTech hashtag#CloudEnthusiasts hashtag#TechOpportunities hashtag#Cloud hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Database hashtag#Learning hashtag#Hiring hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#DevOps hashtag#FreeLabs hashtag#HandsOn hashtag#Cloud hashtag#Docker hashtag#Kubernetes hashtag#CICD hashtag#AWS hashtag#Learning hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobOpening
