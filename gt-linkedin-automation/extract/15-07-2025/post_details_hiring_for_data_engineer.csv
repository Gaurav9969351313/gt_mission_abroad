Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection.

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection.

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection.

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection.

Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open. Ready to ride?#Tech #AI #Career #IndianIT #Upskilling

Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Spencer Baloga LoufekSpencer Baloga Loufek,,"✨ Exciting News! ✨I’m thrilled to share that I am officially a first-time author! Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection. Your support made this research possible!💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts: What non-technical skills do you think are most important for entry-level engineers?hashtag#ESEM hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CareerDevelopment hashtag#Research

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?

Ravish ChoudharyRavish Choudhary,,"The Indian IT dream, once a golden ticket for millions, is crumbling. In a recent article, the harsh reality hits home: entry-level tech jobs are vanishing, with giants like Wipro slashing fresher hires from 38,000 (FY23) to 10,000 (FY25). AI, from tools like GitHub Copilot to ChatGPT, is automating basic coding and support roles, leaving fresh grads in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Pune scrolling job portals in despair. Globally, it’s no better—US computer science grads face 7.5% unemployment, and the World Economic Forum predicts AI will eliminate 75M jobs while creating 170M new ones.The problem? Our education system is stuck in 2015, with only 12% of Indian engineering colleges teaching AI or data science. Meanwhile, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are hiring—but they want thinkers, not coders, from top-tier institutes. Yet, there’s hope. AI is birthing roles like prompt engineers and model auditors, accessible to those who adapt fast. This isn’t the end—it’s a pivot point. AI isn’t the enemy; it’s your co-pilot. Upskill in AI tools, chase internships, and think beyond code to domain expertise. The old IT ladder is broken, but the highway to new-age roles is wide open.

Our paper, “Beyond the Job Posting: What Hiring Managers Seek in Entry-Level Software Engineering Candidates”, co-authored with Bianca Trinkenreich, Ph.D. and Fabio Santos, PhD, has been accepted to the ESEM Conference (Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement)!Our research focused on two main questions: 1️⃣ What do hiring managers expect from entry-level software engineering candidates? 2️⃣ How are these expectations reflected in job postings?Here are some key insights: ✅ Hiring managers prioritize non-technical skills such as Adaptability, Proactivity, Dependability, Self-Direction, Passion, Collaboration, Communication, Problem Solving, Courage, Self-Awareness, Self-Confidence, Willingness to Learn, and a Process-Oriented Mindset. ✅ Most of these skills are not explicitly stated in job postings.This means many graduates may feel deterred by technical requirements in postings—yet hiring managers care deeply about these essential non-technical skills that help candidates grow their technical toolkit over time.A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to our data collection.

Darshil ParmarDarshil Parmar,,"Cracking the Data Engineering Interview: My Complete Guide ⬇️Day by day, demand for Data Engineers is increasing, but many people are still complaining, ""Companies are not hiring for the DE role.""It's not a hiring issue, but finding skilled employees is very difficult these daysHere’s a roadmap that I believe every aspiring data engineer should follow to confidently crack interviews at top companies ⬇️I have also shared the complete bootcamp link in the comment📘 Step 1: Master the FundamentalsYou need to go beyond tutorials and build a deep understanding in:👉🏻 Python 🐍: Data structures, functions, file handling, APIs👉🏻 SQL: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, performance tuning👉🏻 Data Modeling: Star vs Snowflake schema, OLTP vs OLAP, Slowly Changing Dimensions📚 Pro Tip: Practice with real business scenarios. Don't just SELECT * FROM knowledge.⚙️ Step 2: Tools of the TradeYou’ll be expected to work with:👉🏻 ETL Tools: Airflow, dbt, Glue👉🏻 Data Lakes & Warehouses: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3👉🏻 Big Data Processing: Apache Spark, Kafka, HadoopCloud Platforms: AWS/GCP/Azure basics (IAM, EC2, S3, etc.)💡 Interviewers love to ask: “How would you build a pipeline if X data came in late or failed?”🧠 Step 3: Think Like an EngineerMost candidates fail not because they can’t code, but because they can’t design and debug pipelines.Prepare to answer:“How would you design a pipeline to ingest millions of rows daily?”“How do you ensure data quality and integrity?”“What happens if schema changes mid-stream?”Draw diagrams. Break down the problem. Think out loud.📊 Step 4: Projects > CertificatesReal-world projects >>> random certs.✅ Build an end-to-end pipeline:- Ingest data from an API- Transform it using Spark/dbt- Store it in a warehouse- Visualize it with Looker or Power BIThis shows not only your skills but also your ability to ship production-ready data systems.🔁 Step 5: Mock Interviews & Feedback LoopsDon't prepare in isolation.📈 Do peer mock interviews🛠️ Use platforms like DataVidhya Code+ to practice PySpark, SQL, Python, DBT, and build Data Models💬 Ask for resume and project feedback from industry professionals.What if I tell you, everything I mentioned above, you can get it at just one place❌ No more jumping from resource to resource, learn everything in one place!Interested?
