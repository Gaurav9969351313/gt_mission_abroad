Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 6 Done 🎉 my sixth assignment . Iam also proud to say this summit my  exciting that part. thanks a lot from Rakshana mam. Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 6 Done 🎉 my sixth assignment . Iam also proud to say this summit my  exciting that part. thanks a lot from Rakshana mam. Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 6 Done 🎉 my sixth assignment . Iam also proud to say this summit my  exciting that part. thanks a lot from Rakshana mam. Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 6 Done 🎉 my sixth assignment . Iam also proud to say this summit my  exciting that part. thanks a lot from Rakshana mam. Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Whether any state in India is a marketing job or operations. Work is one. Business does not come by making pressure in marketing candidate  jobs, what is your company's value . How much is the productivity of your hospital in every city. Good quality , good team. Good management, good patient satisfaction. Be it Delhi NCR or Mumbai. Or Banglore  Marketing part is the largest part and selection of employees on its quality and not from his state that he is a candidate. We are all Indians.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 6 Done 🎉 my sixth assignment . Iam also proud to say this summit my  exciting that part. thanks a lot from Rakshana mam. Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Gautam KeswaniGautam Keswani,,"The dangers of working from home!A few days ago, something unexpected happened at our recording studio.We had a voice-over session scheduled, and a creative resource from one of the biggest audio platforms in India was sent to direct the voice artist. When he arrived, the voice artist was already in the recording booth, and I escorted him to the control room, introducing him to the sound engineer.I asked him to brief the artist before we started. To my surprise, he started walking out of the studio. When I asked where he was going, he replied that he needed to go inside the recording booth to speak to the artist. I told him that we have microphones on both sides of the studio—he could communicate with her from where he was. His reaction? Absolute surprise.Then he admitted—this was his first time ever inside a recording studio.This was shocking. A creative professional working at a leading audio platform had never stepped into a studio and yet was given the responsibility of directing a session of an important 'audio project'.And this is where the real problem lies.Remote working, especially at the start of a career, can limit learning and skill enhancement. When someone spends years in a remote job without real-world exposure, they risk becoming disconnected from practical industry knowledge. They might earn a good salary early on, thanks to well-funded companies that prioritize hiring over true expertise, but when faced with real-world challenges, they are bound to struggle.What happens then? Someone with fewer years of experience but hands-on skills surpasses them in career growth.The takeaway? At the start of your career, prioritize learning over comfort. Step into the real world, interact, observe, work as interns and build skills beyond what’s written in a job description. Because eventually, knowledge beats experience—if that experience lacks true expertise.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you think remote work impacts early-career growth?hashtag#workfromhome hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#skills hashtag#career hashtag#careergrowth hashtag#audioplatform hashtag#audiostreaming

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Corinne RothblumCorinne Rothblum,,"Of interest to folks in or considering the ""other Georgia."""
Gautam KeswaniGautam Keswani,,"The dangers of working from home!A few days ago, something unexpected happened at our recording studio.We had a voice-over session scheduled, and a creative resource from one of the biggest audio platforms in India was sent to direct the voice artist. When he arrived, the voice artist was already in the recording booth, and I escorted him to the control room, introducing him to the sound engineer.I asked him to brief the artist before we started. To my surprise, he started walking out of the studio. When I asked where he was going, he replied that he needed to go inside the recording booth to speak to the artist. I told him that we have microphones on both sides of the studio—he could communicate with her from where he was. His reaction? Absolute surprise.Then he admitted—this was his first time ever inside a recording studio.This was shocking. A creative professional working at a leading audio platform had never stepped into a studio and yet was given the responsibility of directing a session of an important 'audio project'.And this is where the real problem lies.Remote working, especially at the start of a career, can limit learning and skill enhancement. When someone spends years in a remote job without real-world exposure, they risk becoming disconnected from practical industry knowledge. They might earn a good salary early on, thanks to well-funded companies that prioritize hiring over true expertise, but when faced with real-world challenges, they are bound to struggle.What happens then? Someone with fewer years of experience but hands-on skills surpasses them in career growth.The takeaway? At the start of your career, prioritize learning over comfort. Step into the real world, interact, observe, work as interns and build skills beyond what’s written in a job description. Because eventually, knowledge beats experience—if that experience lacks true expertise.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you think remote work impacts early-career growth?hashtag#workfromhome hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#skills hashtag#career hashtag#careergrowth hashtag#audioplatform hashtag#audiostreaming

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Shenouda IsaacShenouda Isaac,,"""If you want to truly learn something, you need to understand its basics in depth."" Today, I want to share how I learned about Threads in Java and my key takeaways.🔹 What is a Thread? A thread is an execution context, which is all the information a CPU needs to execute a stream of instructions.Suppose you're reading a book, and you want to take a break right now, but you want to be able to come back and resume reading from the exact point where you stopped. One way to achieve that is by jotting down the page number, line number, and word number. So your execution context for reading a book is these 3 numbers.If you have a roommate, and she's using the same technique, she can take the book while you're not using it, and resume reading from where she stopped. Then you can take it back, and resume it from where you were.Threads work in the same way. A CPU is giving you the illusion that it's doing multiple computations at the same time. It does that by spending a bit of time on each computation. It can do that because it has an execution context for each computation. Just like you can share a book with your friend, many tasks can share a CPU.On a more technical level, an execution context (therefore a thread) consists of the values of the CPU's registers.

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 8 Done 🎉 my Eighth assignment. I am also proud to  say  this entertainment. 🎯 learning about from java.INHERITANCE:Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. Here's a detailed explanation of inheritance in Java:Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. The class that is being inherited is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that is doing the inheriting is called the subclass or child class.Types of InheritanceThere are several types of inheritance in Java:1. *Single Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a single superclass.2. *Multilevel Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from a superclass that itself inherits from another superclass.3. *Hierarchical Inheritance*: A superclass is inherited by multiple subclasses.4. *Multiple Inheritance*: A subclass inherits from multiple superclasses. (Not directly supported in Java, but can be achieved using interfaces)Benefits of Inheritance1. *Code Reusability*: Inheritance allows for code reusability, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass.2. *Easier Maintenance*: Inheritance makes it easier to maintain and modify code, as changes to the superclass can be automatically inherited by the subclass.3. *Improved Readability*: Inheritance can improve the readability of code, as the subclass can inherit the properties and behavior of the superclass without having to duplicate code.hashtag#Codinglifehashtag#JavaJourneyhashtag#Codeschallenge

Dhariksha PDhariksha P,,"Hello Everyone!!! Day 6 Done 🎉 my sixth assignment . Iam also proud to say this summit my  exciting that part. thanks a lot from Rakshana mam. Encapsulation:Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java that binds together the data and the methods that manipulate that data, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Here's a detailed explanation of encapsulation in Java:Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the methods (functions) together as a single unit, which is called a class. This helps to protect the data from external interference and misuse.Benefits of Encapsulation1. *Data Hiding*: Encapsulation helps to hide the data from external sources, which makes it secure.2. *Code Reusability*: Encapsulation promotes code reusability, as the code can be used in multiple programs.3. *Improved Code Organization*: Encapsulation helps to organize the code in a better way, as the data and methods are wrapped together in a single unit.To achieve encapsulation in Java, you need to follow these steps:1. *Declare the variables as private*: This will prevent the variables from being accessed directly from outside the class.2. *Provide public methods to access and modify the variables*: This will allow the variables to be accessed and modified in a controlled way.hashtag#cCodinglifehashtag#Javalearninghashtag#CybernautEdu-Tech

Corinne RothblumCorinne Rothblum,,"Of interest to folks in or considering the ""other Georgia."""
Gautam KeswaniGautam Keswani,,"The dangers of working from home!A few days ago, something unexpected happened at our recording studio.We had a voice-over session scheduled, and a creative resource from one of the biggest audio platforms in India was sent to direct the voice artist. When he arrived, the voice artist was already in the recording booth, and I escorted him to the control room, introducing him to the sound engineer.I asked him to brief the artist before we started. To my surprise, he started walking out of the studio. When I asked where he was going, he replied that he needed to go inside the recording booth to speak to the artist. I told him that we have microphones on both sides of the studio—he could communicate with her from where he was. His reaction? Absolute surprise.Then he admitted—this was his first time ever inside a recording studio.This was shocking. A creative professional working at a leading audio platform had never stepped into a studio and yet was given the responsibility of directing a session of an important 'audio project'.And this is where the real problem lies.Remote working, especially at the start of a career, can limit learning and skill enhancement. When someone spends years in a remote job without real-world exposure, they risk becoming disconnected from practical industry knowledge. They might earn a good salary early on, thanks to well-funded companies that prioritize hiring over true expertise, but when faced with real-world challenges, they are bound to struggle.What happens then? Someone with fewer years of experience but hands-on skills surpasses them in career growth.The takeaway? At the start of your career, prioritize learning over comfort. Step into the real world, interact, observe, work as interns and build skills beyond what’s written in a job description. Because eventually, knowledge beats experience—if that experience lacks true expertise.Would love to hear your thoughts—how do you think remote work impacts early-career growth?hashtag#workfromhome hashtag#remoteworking hashtag#remotejobs hashtag#skills hashtag#career hashtag#careergrowth hashtag#audioplatform hashtag#audiostreaming
