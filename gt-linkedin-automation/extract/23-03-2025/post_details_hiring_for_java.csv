Despite investing lakhs in their education/courses like MBA / M. com and many more they are often offered minimal salaries or placed in non-strategic roles like telecalling.This brings up a crucial question—are companies genuinely hiring freshers, or are these job postings merely for visibility? Moreover, why is the hiring process shifting towards engagement tactics like asking candidates to comment # Interested instead of directly evaluating applications?Freshers should be hired, not ignored—because experience is built through training, dedication, and hard work, not just prior employment.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Despite investing lakhs in their education/courses like MBA / M. com and many more they are often offered minimal salaries or placed in non-strategic roles like telecalling.This brings up a crucial question—are companies genuinely hiring freshers, or are these job postings merely for visibility? Moreover, why is the hiring process shifting towards engagement tactics like asking candidates to comment # Interested instead of directly evaluating applications?Freshers should be hired, not ignored—because experience is built through training, dedication, and hard work, not just prior employment.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

He had strong technical knowledge in Java, Data Structures, and SQL but had failed multiple interviews.Curious, I asked him to simulate an interview with me.📌 His problem wasn’t lack of knowledge—it was poor communication. He hesitated, struggled to frame sentences, and lacked confidence.👉 This is where many job seekers, especially freshers, go wrong. Interview success isn’t just about technical skills—it’s about how well you communicate them!Here’s what makes a difference:✅ Structured Responses – Employers look for clear, concise answers.✅ Confident Delivery – Your tone and clarity matter.✅ Body Language & Fluency – A strong presence leaves a lasting impression.After working on these, he cracked his next interview!💬 Do you think technical skills alone are enough to crack a job interview? hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#CommunicationSkills hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Freshers hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CampusPlacement hashtag#HR hashtag#TechnicalInterviews

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

He had strong technical knowledge in Java, Data Structures, and SQL but had failed multiple interviews.Curious, I asked him to simulate an interview with me.📌 His problem wasn’t lack of knowledge—it was poor communication. He hesitated, struggled to frame sentences, and lacked confidence.👉 This is where many job seekers, especially freshers, go wrong. Interview success isn’t just about technical skills—it’s about how well you communicate them!Here’s what makes a difference:✅ Structured Responses – Employers look for clear, concise answers.✅ Confident Delivery – Your tone and clarity matter.✅ Body Language & Fluency – A strong presence leaves a lasting impression.After working on these, he cracked his next interview!💬 Do you think technical skills alone are enough to crack a job interview? hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#CommunicationSkills hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Freshers hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CampusPlacement hashtag#HR hashtag#TechnicalInterviews

Despite investing lakhs in their education/courses like MBA / M. com and many more they are often offered minimal salaries or placed in non-strategic roles like telecalling.This brings up a crucial question—are companies genuinely hiring freshers, or are these job postings merely for visibility? Moreover, why is the hiring process shifting towards engagement tactics like asking candidates to comment # Interested instead of directly evaluating applications?Freshers should be hired, not ignored—because experience is built through training, dedication, and hard work, not just prior employment.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

He had strong technical knowledge in Java, Data Structures, and SQL but had failed multiple interviews.Curious, I asked him to simulate an interview with me.📌 His problem wasn’t lack of knowledge—it was poor communication. He hesitated, struggled to frame sentences, and lacked confidence.👉 This is where many job seekers, especially freshers, go wrong. Interview success isn’t just about technical skills—it’s about how well you communicate them!Here’s what makes a difference:✅ Structured Responses – Employers look for clear, concise answers.✅ Confident Delivery – Your tone and clarity matter.✅ Body Language & Fluency – A strong presence leaves a lasting impression.After working on these, he cracked his next interview!💬 Do you think technical skills alone are enough to crack a job interview? hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#CommunicationSkills hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Freshers hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CampusPlacement hashtag#HR hashtag#TechnicalInterviews

The real magic is their pitch: “𝘞𝘦 𝘰𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘳 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯!” Translation: “𝘞𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵 SpaceX 𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘢𝘵 𝘣𝘪𝘤𝘺𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘴.” Why pay top dollar when you can dangle vague promises of “exposure” or equity in a company whose roadmap ends at “maybe break even by 2035”?Let’s recap this fair game:Requirements: Solve world hunger, reverse climate change, and maintain eye contact during Zoom calls.Compensation: “Competitive” = slightly above poverty line, but hey, we’ve got beanbags!Timeline: Need you yesterday. Also, 8 rounds of interviews to prove you’re not a bot.Of course, when no one applies, recruiters are shocked. “𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘷𝘪𝘣𝘦𝘴?” Maybe hunting Bigfoot? Or busy laughing at your salary band?Pro tip, folks: If you want a candidate who’s “self-motivated, resilient, and thrives under pressure,” try offering more than a pizza party and a pat on the back. Otherwise, enjoy your 12-month search for a ghost who doesn’t exist.But what do I know? I’m just someone who thinks “fair” shouldn’t mean “delusional.”

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

He had strong technical knowledge in Java, Data Structures, and SQL but had failed multiple interviews.Curious, I asked him to simulate an interview with me.📌 His problem wasn’t lack of knowledge—it was poor communication. He hesitated, struggled to frame sentences, and lacked confidence.👉 This is where many job seekers, especially freshers, go wrong. Interview success isn’t just about technical skills—it’s about how well you communicate them!Here’s what makes a difference:✅ Structured Responses – Employers look for clear, concise answers.✅ Confident Delivery – Your tone and clarity matter.✅ Body Language & Fluency – A strong presence leaves a lasting impression.After working on these, he cracked his next interview!💬 Do you think technical skills alone are enough to crack a job interview? hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#CommunicationSkills hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Freshers hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CampusPlacement hashtag#HR hashtag#TechnicalInterviews

Oleksiy KhropakOleksiy Khropak,,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗼𝗳 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴Ah, the noble recruiter: tirelessly hunting for that mythical “unicorn” who codes in 10 languages, has 15 years of experience in a 5-year-old framework, and moonlights as a neurosurgeon—all while vibing with our “chill, fast-paced startup culture.”But wait! The real magic is their pitch: “𝘞𝘦 𝘰𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘳 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯!” Translation: “𝘞𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵 SpaceX 𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘢𝘵 𝘣𝘪𝘤𝘺𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘴.” Why pay top dollar when you can dangle vague promises of “exposure” or equity in a company whose roadmap ends at “maybe break even by 2035”?Let’s recap this fair game:Requirements: Solve world hunger, reverse climate change, and maintain eye contact during Zoom calls.Compensation: “Competitive” = slightly above poverty line, but hey, we’ve got beanbags!Timeline: Need you yesterday. Also, 8 rounds of interviews to prove you’re not a bot.Of course, when no one applies, recruiters are shocked. “𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘷𝘪𝘣𝘦𝘴?” Maybe hunting Bigfoot? Or busy laughing at your salary band?Pro tip, folks: If you want a candidate who’s “self-motivated, resilient, and thrives under pressure,” try offering more than a pizza party and a pat on the back. Otherwise, enjoy your 12-month search for a ghost who doesn’t exist.But what do I know? I’m just someone who thinks “fair” shouldn’t mean “delusional.”

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

He had strong technical knowledge in Java, Data Structures, and SQL but had failed multiple interviews.Curious, I asked him to simulate an interview with me.📌 His problem wasn’t lack of knowledge—it was poor communication. He hesitated, struggled to frame sentences, and lacked confidence.👉 This is where many job seekers, especially freshers, go wrong. Interview success isn’t just about technical skills—it’s about how well you communicate them!Here’s what makes a difference:✅ Structured Responses – Employers look for clear, concise answers.✅ Confident Delivery – Your tone and clarity matter.✅ Body Language & Fluency – A strong presence leaves a lasting impression.After working on these, he cracked his next interview!💬 Do you think technical skills alone are enough to crack a job interview? hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#CommunicationSkills hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Freshers hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CampusPlacement hashtag#HR hashtag#TechnicalInterviews

Oleksiy KhropakOleksiy Khropak,,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗼𝗳 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗻 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗿𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴Ah, the noble recruiter: tirelessly hunting for that mythical “unicorn” who codes in 10 languages, has 15 years of experience in a 5-year-old framework, and moonlights as a neurosurgeon—all while vibing with our “chill, fast-paced startup culture.”But wait! The real magic is their pitch: “𝘞𝘦 𝘰𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘳 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯!” Translation: “𝘞𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵 SpaceX 𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘢𝘵 𝘣𝘪𝘤𝘺𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘴.” Why pay top dollar when you can dangle vague promises of “exposure” or equity in a company whose roadmap ends at “maybe break even by 2035”?Let’s recap this fair game:Requirements: Solve world hunger, reverse climate change, and maintain eye contact during Zoom calls.Compensation: “Competitive” = slightly above poverty line, but hey, we’ve got beanbags!Timeline: Need you yesterday. Also, 8 rounds of interviews to prove you’re not a bot.Of course, when no one applies, recruiters are shocked. “𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘷𝘪𝘣𝘦𝘴?” Maybe hunting Bigfoot? Or busy laughing at your salary band?Pro tip, folks: If you want a candidate who’s “self-motivated, resilient, and thrives under pressure,” try offering more than a pizza party and a pat on the back. Otherwise, enjoy your 12-month search for a ghost who doesn’t exist.But what do I know? I’m just someone who thinks “fair” shouldn’t mean “delusional.”

Never hiring the right one.I've seen businesses hesitate; waiting for the ""perfect"" candidate, delaying decisions, and losing top talent to faster-moving competitors.The truth? High performers don’t wait. And in today’s fast-paced world, the opportunity cost of inaction is higher than the cost of a mistake.Hire for potential. Hire for adaptability. Hire before your competitor does.hashtag#Stat: ""The average financial cost of a bad hire is up to 30% of the employee’s first-year earnings.

Sushant S.Sushant S.,,"|Simplifying Dependency Injection in Spring| Dependency Injection (DI) is a cornerstone of the Spring Framework, promoting clean and modular code. Here's a quick overview of its types: 1. Constructor Injection: Dependencies are passed via constructors. Perfect for mandatory dependencies and ensuring immutability. 2. Setter Injection: Dependencies are set via setter methods. Great for optional or changeable dependencies during runtime. 3. Field Injection: Dependencies are directly injected into class fields using annotations like @Autowired. While concise, it tightly couples the code to Spring. Choosing the right approach depends on your use case. Constructor injection is favored for its clarity and immutability, while setter injection offers flexibility, and field injection simplifies implementation. How do you decide on the right injection method for your projects? Let’s discuss. hashtag#SpringFramework hashtag#DependencyInjection hashtag#JavaDevelopment

He had strong technical knowledge in Java, Data Structures, and SQL but had failed multiple interviews.Curious, I asked him to simulate an interview with me.📌 His problem wasn’t lack of knowledge—it was poor communication. He hesitated, struggled to frame sentences, and lacked confidence.👉 This is where many job seekers, especially freshers, go wrong. Interview success isn’t just about technical skills—it’s about how well you communicate them!Here’s what makes a difference:✅ Structured Responses – Employers look for clear, concise answers.✅ Confident Delivery – Your tone and clarity matter.✅ Body Language & Fluency – A strong presence leaves a lasting impression.After working on these, he cracked his next interview!💬 Do you think technical skills alone are enough to crack a job interview? hashtag#InterviewTips hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#SoftSkills hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#CommunicationSkills hashtag#InterviewPreparation hashtag#Freshers hashtag#Hiring hashtag#CampusPlacement hashtag#HR hashtag#TechnicalInterviews

The real magic is their pitch: “𝘞𝘦 𝘰𝘧𝘧𝘦𝘳 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯!” Translation: “𝘞𝘦 𝘸𝘢𝘯𝘵 SpaceX 𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘢𝘵 𝘣𝘪𝘤𝘺𝘤𝘭𝘦 𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘴.” Why pay top dollar when you can dangle vague promises of “exposure” or equity in a company whose roadmap ends at “maybe break even by 2035”?Let’s recap this fair game:Requirements: Solve world hunger, reverse climate change, and maintain eye contact during Zoom calls.Compensation: “Competitive” = slightly above poverty line, but hey, we’ve got beanbags!Timeline: Need you yesterday. Also, 8 rounds of interviews to prove you’re not a bot.Of course, when no one applies, recruiters are shocked. “𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘦𝘹𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘴 𝘸𝘩𝘰 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬 𝘧𝘰𝘳 𝘷𝘪𝘣𝘦𝘴?” Maybe hunting Bigfoot? Or busy laughing at your salary band?Pro tip, folks: If you want a candidate who’s “self-motivated, resilient, and thrives under pressure,” try offering more than a pizza party and a pat on the back. Otherwise, enjoy your 12-month search for a ghost who doesn’t exist.But what do I know? I’m just someone who thinks “fair” shouldn’t mean “delusional.”

High performers don’t wait. And in today’s fast-paced world, the opportunity cost of inaction is higher than the cost of a mistake.Hire for potential. Hire for adaptability. Hire before your competitor does.hashtag#Stat: ""The average financial cost of a bad hire is up to 30% of the employee’s first-year earnings. According to another report, companies hiring for adaptability grow revenue 2.5x faster than peers. Yet 75% of hiring managers still reject candidates for ‘not checking every box"".What do you think’s worse: a bad hire or a missed hire? Let’s discuss.hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Recruiting hashtag#HR hashtag#HiringStrategy hashtag#TalentManagement hashtag#HiringMistakes hashtag#TalentShortage hashtag#BusinessGrowth hashtag#BadHireVsMissedHire hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#Adaptability hashtag#HRStats
