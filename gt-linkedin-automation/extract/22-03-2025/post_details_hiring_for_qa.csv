Mohned MohamedMohned Mohamed,,"Siemens Digital Industries Software is hiring a Software QA Engineer to join our team in Cairo, Egypt.The Calibre xRC tool offers robust parasitic extraction, delivering highly accurate parasitic data for comprehensive post-layout analysis and simulation. This rule-based extraction tool processes a design layout using a two-dimensional representation of its physical shapes (e.g., GDSII). It identifies patterns within the layout that match predefined extraction models, performs calculations based on actual design dimensions, and generates an extracted netlist. This netlist includes both the design circuit and its extracted parasitic components.  The extracted netlist is then used by SPICE circuit simulators and static timing analysis (STA) tools to refine the design, ensuring optimal performance, and eliminating potential operational issues.  Responsibilities:  * Advocate for quality processes and procedures throughout the product lifecycle, including inspections, code reviews, and requirements analysis. * Establish quality expectations, develop a plan to measure them, and ensure successful execution. * Ensure schedule predictability and track progress against objectives. * Assess and verify product functionality, usability, reliability, and serviceability in real-world customer environments. * Collaborate with customers, marketing, and customer support teams to understand requirements and user expectations. * Document past verification and validation efforts for reproducibility. * Conduct product testing to identify defects, limitations, and potential failure points. * Work closely with global engineering and QA teams to ensure high-quality outcomes. * Review functional and design specifications, internal and external product documentation, and provide feedback to key stakeholders (e.g., KPD, third-party providers). * Coordinate with software development and release teams to ensure smooth and reliable software releases.  Qualifications:  * B.Sc. or M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Communication, or Computer Engineering. * Strong understanding of programming concepts. * Solid knowledge of scripting languages. * Proficiency in IC physical design, layout, and verification tools, as well as IC manufacturing processes. * Familiarity with Software Quality Assurance processes and software testing concepts (a plus). * Experience working with Linux/Unix operating systems. * Excellent communication skills with the ability to collaborate with Marketing (MKT) and R&D teams to understand software features and customer requirements. * Self-motivated with a strong aptitude for continuous learning.You can apply through: https://myjob.io/BhPdGW4

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Lexie .Lexie .,,"Why Are Top Game Studios Embracing Outsourcing? Game studio outsourcing refers to delegating specific parts of game development to external teams or companies. These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Mohned MohamedMohned Mohamed,,"Siemens Digital Industries Software is hiring a Software QA Engineer to join our team in Cairo, Egypt.The Calibre xRC tool offers robust parasitic extraction, delivering highly accurate parasitic data for comprehensive post-layout analysis and simulation. This rule-based extraction tool processes a design layout using a two-dimensional representation of its physical shapes (e.g., GDSII). It identifies patterns within the layout that match predefined extraction models, performs calculations based on actual design dimensions, and generates an extracted netlist.

Lexie .Lexie .,,"Why Are Top Game Studios Embracing Outsourcing? Game studio outsourcing refers to delegating specific parts of game development to external teams or companies. These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Lexie .Lexie .,,"Why Are Top Game Studios Embracing Outsourcing? Game studio outsourcing refers to delegating specific parts of game development to external teams or companies. These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Mohned MohamedMohned Mohamed,,"Siemens Digital Industries Software is hiring a Software QA Engineer to join our team in Cairo, Egypt.The Calibre xRC tool offers robust parasitic extraction, delivering highly accurate parasitic data for comprehensive post-layout analysis and simulation.

This netlist includes both the design circuit and its extracted parasitic components.  The extracted netlist is then used by SPICE circuit simulators and static timing analysis (STA) tools to refine the design, ensuring optimal performance, and eliminating potential operational issues.  Responsibilities:  * Advocate for quality processes and procedures throughout the product lifecycle, including inspections, code reviews, and requirements analysis. * Establish quality expectations, develop a plan to measure them, and ensure successful execution. * Ensure schedule predictability and track progress against objectives. * Assess and verify product functionality, usability, reliability, and serviceability in real-world customer environments. * Collaborate with customers, marketing, and customer support teams to understand requirements and user expectations. * Document past verification and validation efforts for reproducibility. * Conduct product testing to identify defects, limitations, and potential failure points. * Work closely with global engineering and QA teams to ensure high-quality outcomes. * Review functional and design specifications, internal and external product documentation, and provide feedback to key stakeholders (e.g., KPD, third-party providers). * Coordinate with software development and release teams to ensure smooth and reliable software releases.  Qualifications:  * B.Sc. or M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering, Electronics & Communication, or Computer Engineering. * Strong understanding of programming concepts. * Solid knowledge of scripting languages. * Proficiency in IC physical design, layout, and verification tools, as well as IC manufacturing processes. * Familiarity with Software Quality Assurance processes and software testing concepts (a plus). * Experience working with Linux/Unix operating systems. * Excellent communication skills with the ability to collaborate with Marketing (MKT) and R&D teams to understand software features and customer requirements. * Self-motivated with a strong aptitude for continuous learning.You can apply through: https://myjob.io/BhPdGW4

Lexie .Lexie .,,"Why Are Top Game Studios Embracing Outsourcing? Game studio outsourcing refers to delegating specific parts of game development to external teams or companies. These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming.

Volodymyr ArtVolodymyr Art,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Volodymyr ArtVolodymyr Art,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇

To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Volodymyr ArtVolodymyr Art,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Volodymyr ArtVolodymyr Art,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Volodymyr ArtVolodymyr Art,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇

Lexie .Lexie .,,"Why Are Top Game Studios Embracing Outsourcing? Game studio outsourcing refers to delegating specific parts of game development to external teams or companies. These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming.

Volodymyr ArtVolodymyr Art,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Volodymyr ArtVolodymyr Art,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇

These can include:2D/3D Art & DesignGame development (Unity, Unreal, etc.)Animation, VFXQA TestingSound & MusicGame portingThe gaming industry is growing rapidly, but development costs and production timelines are also increasing. To maintain high-quality standards while optimizing resources, even industry giants like Ubisoft, Riot Games, and CD Projekt Red rely on outsourcing as a key part of their development pipeline.🔹 Cost Efficiency & Resource OptimizationMaintaining a large in-house team is expensive, especially for AAA projects. Outsourcing reduces overhead costs related to salaries, office space, and software tools, allowing studios to focus their budget where it matters most.🔹 Faster Production CyclesBig studios must accelerate development without sacrificing quality. By partnering with outsourcing teams specializing in art, animation, VFX, and QA, they can focus on core gameplay and overall game design.🔹 Access to Global TalentInstead of being limited by local hiring, outsourcing enables access to top talent worldwide, bringing fresh perspectives and creativity into game development.🔹 Risk Reduction & Development FlexibilityHiring and training new staff for each project is costly and time-consuming. Outsourcing allows studios to scale their workforce up or down as needed, making them more adaptable to industry trends and market demands.At Golden Sea Studio, we provide comprehensive outsourcing solutions, helping game studios optimize resources while maintaining quality and speed.Is your studio ready to leverage outsourcing for growth?hashtag#gameoutsourcing hashtag#gamedevelopment hashtag#goldenseastudio

Volodymyr ArtVolodymyr Art,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇
