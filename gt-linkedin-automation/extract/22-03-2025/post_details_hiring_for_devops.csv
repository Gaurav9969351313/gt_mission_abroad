Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Ammar MalikAmmar Malik,,"Why You Should Hire Me as Your Next IT Engineer🔹 My Journey in IT EngineeringFrom the beginning of my career, I have been passionate about technology, security, and automation. I started as an IT professional managing servers and troubleshooting network issues. Over time, I dived into DevSecOps and Cloud Computing, gaining expertise in AWS, Azure, Linux Administration, CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible.Throughout my journey, I have worked on streamlining IT operations, automating deployments, and strengthening cybersecurity measures. My goal has always been to create IT solutions that are not only efficient and scalable but also secure and resilient.🔹 What Makes Me Different?Many IT engineers can fix problems, but I focus on preventing them before they occur. Here’s how:✅ Security-First Approach – I integrate DevSecOps principles into IT operations to ensure secure deployments and protect against vulnerabilities.✅ Automation & Efficiency – I automate repetitive tasks to reduce downtime, minimize human errors, and increase productivity.✅ Cloud Expertise – Whether it’s migrating applications to the cloud or optimizing cloud resources, I ensure businesses maximize their cloud potential.🔹 My Key Skills & ExpertiseIT Infrastructure & Cloud Computing: AWS, Azure, Google CloudAutomation & DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelinesCybersecurity & DevSecOps: Firewalls, SIEM solutions, Penetration Testing, Secure CodingSoftware Development & Web Technologies: Python, JavaScript, Linux AdministrationNetwork Administration & Troubleshooting🔹 My Impact in Previous RolesIn my past roles, I have successfully:🚀 Reduced deployment time by 50% by implementing a fully automated CI/CD pipeline🚀 Enhanced network security by configuring firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and multi-factor authentication🚀 Optimized cloud infrastructure, resulting in cost savings and improved performance🚀 Developed secure web applications by following industry-standard security practices🚀 Trained teams on cybersecurity best practices, significantly reducing security risks🔹 Looking for My Next OpportunityI am currently open to new opportunities where I can contribute my skills and help businesses scale their IT operations, improve security, and implement efficient DevSecOps strategies.

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Ammar MalikAmmar Malik,,"Why You Should Hire Me as Your Next IT Engineer🔹 My Journey in IT EngineeringFrom the beginning of my career, I have been passionate about technology, security, and automation. I started as an IT professional managing servers and troubleshooting network issues. Over time, I dived into DevSecOps and Cloud Computing, gaining expertise in AWS, Azure, Linux Administration, CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible.Throughout my journey, I have worked on streamlining IT operations, automating deployments, and strengthening cybersecurity measures. My goal has always been to create IT solutions that are not only efficient and scalable but also secure and resilient.🔹 What Makes Me Different?Many IT engineers can fix problems, but I focus on preventing them before they occur. Here’s how:✅ Security-First Approach – I integrate DevSecOps principles into IT operations to ensure secure deployments and protect against vulnerabilities.✅ Automation & Efficiency – I automate repetitive tasks to reduce downtime, minimize human errors, and increase productivity.✅ Cloud Expertise – Whether it’s migrating applications to the cloud or optimizing cloud resources, I ensure businesses maximize their cloud potential.🔹 My Key Skills & ExpertiseIT Infrastructure & Cloud Computing: AWS, Azure, Google CloudAutomation & DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelinesCybersecurity & DevSecOps: Firewalls, SIEM solutions, Penetration Testing, Secure CodingSoftware Development & Web Technologies: Python, JavaScript, Linux AdministrationNetwork Administration & Troubleshooting🔹 My Impact in Previous RolesIn my past roles, I have successfully:🚀 Reduced deployment time by 50% by implementing a fully automated CI/CD pipeline🚀 Enhanced network security by configuring firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and multi-factor authentication🚀 Optimized cloud infrastructure, resulting in cost savings and improved performance🚀 Developed secure web applications by following industry-standard security practices🚀 Trained teams on cybersecurity best practices, significantly reducing security risks🔹 Looking for My Next OpportunityI am currently open to new opportunities where I can contribute my skills and help businesses scale their IT operations, improve security, and implement efficient DevSecOps strategies. If your company is looking for an IT Engineer, DevSecOps Specialist, or Cloud Security Expert, I’d love to connect!hashtag#ITEngineer hashtag#Hiring hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#DevSecOps hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#AWSJobs hashtag#LinuxAdministrator hashtag#Automation hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#NowHiring hashtag#SoftwareEngineer

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment

Diran OgunlanaDiran Ogunlana,,"If you’re stacking jobs and ghosting meetings, don’t be surprised when companies start wondering if they need any of us at all.Earlier today, a buddy pinged me with this article: “A Gen Xer's plan to earn $800K this year across 6 remote jobs: Hiring people to be him.” I read it, shook my head, and thought—man, we really need to talk about this. I know some people won't be ""happy"" with my take on this but: on one hand, I get it. We all want more security, more freedom, and yeah, more money. Stack a few remote jobs, outsource some tasks, keep your head down, and ride the wave while it lasts. There’s even a part of me that respects the hustle. But here’s where I get stuck. I’m that guy sitting in the Zoom call with his camera on, actually trying to move the project forward… and wondering why the other guy—who, let’s be honest, never shows up—is MIA again. Yeah, the work might get done. Eventually. Kind of. But now I’m questioning the whole setup. And if that’s the game we’re playing, wouldn’t it just be easier for companies to automate your job with AI? If you’re not showing up as a human, why do we need you at all?I don’t say that lightly. I’ve been the guy trying to get a foothold, looking for the next gig, making ends meet. And back in the day, I probably would’ve thought this whole job stacking thing was brilliant. But now? I’ve spent enough time on the other side of the table—building teams, leading projects—to see how this stuff plays out. It’s not just ""getting your bag."" It makes people jaded. Hiring managers start side-eyeing anyone who wants ""more"" remote work. Talented folks looking for their first shot get passed over because companies are too burned to take a risk. So yeah, I get it. But we have to talk about the collateral damage here. Does this help us or hurt us in the long run?hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TeamBuilding hashtag#SoftwareEngineering hashtag#DevOps hashtag#CyberSecurity hashtag#CloudComputing hashtag#WorkLifeBalance hashtag#LeadershipDevelopment hashtag#SoftwareDevelopment
