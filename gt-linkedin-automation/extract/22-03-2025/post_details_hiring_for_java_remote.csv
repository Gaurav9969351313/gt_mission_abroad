César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Akash PayalAkash Payal,,"Let's talk about this topic, guys! Java 24 is pushing the boundaries of performance computing, and one of the most exciting updates is the Vector API (7th Incubator).1. The Vector API allows Java to leverage SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data, enabling parallel execution of mathematical operations. 2. Java can handle vectorized computations efficiently without needing external libraries.3. This is the 9th iteration of the Vector API, and with each release, Java is becoming a stronger in high-performance computing.If we have to work in machine learning, or any heavy applications, i feel this is nice to explore.found few links which will be helpful:https://lnkd.in/dzwivrvVhttps://lnkd.in/duH85QkB

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Anastasiya SevastianovaAnastasiya Sevastianova,,"🗑 Soft. Weak. Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

The Vector API allows Java to leverage SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data, enabling parallel execution of mathematical operations. 2. Java can handle vectorized computations efficiently without needing external libraries.3. This is the 9th iteration of the Vector API, and with each release, Java is becoming a stronger in high-performance computing.If we have to work in machine learning, or any heavy applications, i feel this is nice to explore.found few links which will be helpful:https://lnkd.in/dzwivrvVhttps://lnkd.in/duH85QkB

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Anastasiya SevastianovaAnastasiya Sevastianova,,"🗑 Soft. Weak. Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11.

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

The Vector API allows Java to leverage SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data, enabling parallel execution of mathematical operations. 2. Java can handle vectorized computations efficiently without needing external libraries.3. This is the 9th iteration of the Vector API, and with each release, Java is becoming a stronger in high-performance computing.If we have to work in machine learning, or any heavy applications, i feel this is nice to explore.found few links which will be helpful:https://lnkd.in/dzwivrvVhttps://lnkd.in/duH85QkB

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

The Vector API allows Java to leverage SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data, enabling parallel execution of mathematical operations. 2. Java can handle vectorized computations efficiently without needing external libraries.3. This is the 9th iteration of the Vector API, and with each release, Java is becoming a stronger in high-performance computing.If we have to work in machine learning, or any heavy applications, i feel this is nice to explore.found few links which will be helpful:https://lnkd.in/dzwivrvVhttps://lnkd.in/duH85QkB

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Anastasiya SevastianovaAnastasiya Sevastianova,,"🗑 Soft. Weak. Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

The Vector API allows Java to leverage SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data, enabling parallel execution of mathematical operations. 2. Java can handle vectorized computations efficiently without needing external libraries.3. This is the 9th iteration of the Vector API, and with each release, Java is becoming a stronger in high-performance computing.If we have to work in machine learning, or any heavy applications, i feel this is nice to explore.found few links which will be helpful:https://lnkd.in/dzwivrvVhttps://lnkd.in/duH85QkB

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

Akash PayalAkash Payal,,"Let's talk about this topic, guys! Java 24 is pushing the boundaries of performance computing, and one of the most exciting updates is the Vector API (7th Incubator).1. The Vector API allows Java to leverage SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data, enabling parallel execution of mathematical operations. 2. Java can handle vectorized computations efficiently without needing external libraries.3. This is the 9th iteration of the Vector API, and with each release, Java is becoming a stronger in high-performance computing.If we have to work in machine learning, or any heavy applications, i feel this is nice to explore.found few links which will be helpful:https://lnkd.in/dzwivrvVhttps://lnkd.in/duH85QkB

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

The Vector API allows Java to leverage SIMD - Single Instruction, Multiple Data, enabling parallel execution of mathematical operations. 2. Java can handle vectorized computations efficiently without needing external libraries.3. This is the 9th iteration of the Vector API, and with each release, Java is becoming a stronger in high-performance computing.If we have to work in machine learning, or any heavy applications, i feel this is nice to explore.found few links which will be helpful:https://lnkd.in/dzwivrvVhttps://lnkd.in/duH85QkB

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030

César Soto ValeroCésar Soto Valero,,"I’ve been building software with hashtag#Java for years, and I can say this with absolute confidence: Java is still one of the smartest career bets a developer can make.Why?Because Java isn’t going anywhere.Yet people still say it’s outdated. Dusty. Too verbose. Too “enterprisey.”Wrong.Java quietly powers much of the real world.From the Spotify app on your phone to backend systems moving trillions of financial transactions, Java is there. Relentless. Invisible. Indispensable.It runs Android, Inc. Netflix. LinkedIn. Minecraft. Most banks. Many governments.It’s everywhere.Why?Because Java works!It’s stable. Fast. Secure. Built for scale.And with every new release, it’s getting better.Java 23 is proof the language is only accelerating:✔️ Streamlined syntax →  A “Hello, World!” now takes just a few lines of code.✔️ Pattern matching for primitives → Cleaner logic with less clutter.✔️ Markdown for JavaDocs → Documentation that doesn’t make your eyes bleed.✔️ Immutable records + sealed classes → Safer data structures, fewer bugs, tighter control.What about AI?Well, sure, hashtag#Python dominates ML/DL/AI.But when it’s time to deployments, many real-world AI systems hum quietly on the JVM.Take Uber’s Michelangelo platform, it uses Java to serve real-time machine learning predictions at global scale.And with libraries and frameworks like Deeplearning4j, LangChain4J, and TensorFlow integrations, you don’t have to rebuild your systems in Python to get AI features. You just enhance what you already have.Moreover, I think Java teaches us how to think like an engineer.With strong types and well-established design patterns, Java encourages discipline. It’s simply harder to make a mess.And that discipline? Could sometimes make a difference 🍵

Phantom… The ruthless GC in Java! 🚀When the JVM decides your object is no longer needed, it launches a powerful combo:🔍 MARK – methodically traverses all accessible objects and marks the ones still alive.🗑 SWEEP – mercilessly sends everything unmarked into oblivion.But what kinds of references exist in Java?🔗 StrongReference – “I’ll never let go!” As long as at least one strong reference exists, GC won’t touch the object.💪 SoftReference – “GC, not now, please…” The object is removed only if memory is running low.💨 WeakReference – “Goodbye, no hard feelings.” GC removes it at the first opportunity.👻 PhantomReference – “I’m gone, but still here…” The object is deleted, but you can track when it happens.And now, what’s new in GC?🔥 CMS GC – removed (Java 14). Everything that was ""Concurrent"" and ""Mark-Sweep"" is now history.🚀 G1 GC – now turbo-smart (Java 20). Optimized thread handling makes object removal even faster.⚡ ZGC – now understands object aging (Java 21). It manages both young and old generations – meaning your objects disappear even more efficiently!📈 Java 17 – +8.66% performance boost compared to Java 11. Higher speed, and an even more ruthless GC.So hold on tight to your objects – because GC is now faster, smarter, and more merciless than ever! 😆hashtag#Java hashtag#GarbageCollector hashtag#G1GC hashtag#ZGC hashtag#JavaPerformance hashtag#GCMemoryCleanup

Hamza AhmedHamza Ahmed,,"Remote jobs could be the next big thing in filling the gap left by the 𝗨𝗦𝗔𝗜𝗗 shutdown, especially in refugee settings like Kakuma. When aid disappears, so do the basic services we rely on. But remote work offers a new kind of lifeline one that’s not based on charity, but on opportunity.At StepUp.One, our mission is to reskill and employ 1 million refugees by 2030. We believe the future isn't just about receiving help, but about becoming capable of helping ourselves. Through remote work, refugees can connect with global clients, earn a living, and gain dignity, not just survive, but thrive.Remote jobs mean we don’t have to wait for aid to come back. We can learn, work, and grow from right here, creating sustainable futures for ourselves and our communities.What role do you think remote work could play in solving long-term challenges in refugee camps?Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dCVTixePhashtag#RemoteWorkForRefugees hashtag#StepUpForChange hashtag#1MillionBy2030
