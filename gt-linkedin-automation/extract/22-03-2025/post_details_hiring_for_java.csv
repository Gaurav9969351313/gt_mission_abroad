I don't know how Recruiters can stop this, yes we try to apply by reaching out in DMs, emails, we contact companies and HRs, but since that a lot of job seekers are trying this, recruiters are ignoring our emails and messages wich is totally understandable, we won't blame you for choosing to not get into stress and overwork.At this point, I'm totally lost...hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#letsconnect hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#dubaijobs hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#qatarjobs hashtag#qatar hashtag#werehiring hashtag#discussion

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

I don't know how Recruiters can stop this, yes we try to apply by reaching out in DMs, emails, we contact companies and HRs, but since that a lot of job seekers are trying this, recruiters are ignoring our emails and messages wich is totally understandable, we won't blame you for choosing to not get into stress and overwork.At this point, I'm totally lost...hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#letsconnect hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#dubaijobs hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#qatarjobs hashtag#qatar hashtag#werehiring hashtag#discussion

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

I don't know how Recruiters can stop this, yes we try to apply by reaching out in DMs, emails, we contact companies and HRs, but since that a lot of job seekers are trying this, recruiters are ignoring our emails and messages wich is totally understandable, we won't blame you for choosing to not get into stress and overwork.At this point, I'm totally lost...hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#letsconnect hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#dubaijobs hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#qatarjobs hashtag#qatar hashtag#werehiring hashtag#discussion

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

I don't know how Recruiters can stop this, yes we try to apply by reaching out in DMs, emails, we contact companies and HRs, but since that a lot of job seekers are trying this, recruiters are ignoring our emails and messages wich is totally understandable, we won't blame you for choosing to not get into stress and overwork.At this point, I'm totally lost...hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#letsconnect hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#dubaijobs hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#qatarjobs hashtag#qatar hashtag#werehiring hashtag#discussion

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Arnim KreutzerArnim Kreutzer,,"Yes, Mark Reinholds keynote listed the pain points being worked on, was a highlight for me too."
Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Milek AimenMilek Aimen,,"And now after all the challenges we have in the hashtag#jobs market, like +100 applicants on every position, the bad job descriptions, the extra ""duties"", we're competing against guys using AI generated CVs, CVs that are built to destroy the ATS systems, they literally hack the automated Recruiting systems, eliminating all the competition, then you find yourself out of the top applicants although you meet all requirements and qualifications. I don't know how Recruiters can stop this, yes we try to apply by reaching out in DMs, emails, we contact companies and HRs, but since that a lot of job seekers are trying this, recruiters are ignoring our emails and messages wich is totally understandable, we won't blame you for choosing to not get into stress and overwork.At this point, I'm totally lost...hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#letsconnect hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#dubaijobs hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#qatarjobs hashtag#qatar hashtag#werehiring hashtag#discussion

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Arnim KreutzerArnim Kreutzer,,"Yes, Mark Reinholds keynote listed the pain points being worked on, was a highlight for me too."
Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Arnim KreutzerArnim Kreutzer,,"Yes, Mark Reinholds keynote listed the pain points being worked on, was a highlight for me too."
Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Arnim KreutzerArnim Kreutzer,,"Yes, Mark Reinholds keynote listed the pain points being worked on, was a highlight for me too."
Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

I don't know how Recruiters can stop this, yes we try to apply by reaching out in DMs, emails, we contact companies and HRs, but since that a lot of job seekers are trying this, recruiters are ignoring our emails and messages wich is totally understandable, we won't blame you for choosing to not get into stress and overwork.At this point, I'm totally lost...hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#letsconnect hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#dubaijobs hashtag#dubairealestate hashtag#dubai hashtag#qatarjobs hashtag#qatar hashtag#werehiring hashtag#discussion

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!

Joyce SimkinJoyce Simkin,,"This week I was notified of 6 job postings for a Delphi Developer (or Sr. Delphi Developer) position. Since Delphi is a rare skill needed here in the U.S., did I hit the jackpot? Nope.I was suspicious. And rightfully so.  Four (possibly five) out of the 6 were scams, as far as I can tell. In comparing job listings, they all seemed to be more or less a copy and paste of Apex System's job listing, with a few variations. See for yourself:The legit job posting is by Apex Systems. They even have a disclaimer on their website's careers page warning of scammers. I checked their corporate website and sure enough they are looking for a Sr. Delphi Developer, in Okemos, Michigan ... my old stomping grounds... Sigh.https://lnkd.in/g2QcTPCPNow, the scams (i.e. none of these appear on the corporate careers website of the company that is supposedly hiring):Delphi Developer ‚Äì TheCorporate LinkedIn page says they‚Äôre in Brooklyn; website linked to from their LinkedIn page says they are in Massachusetts. Logos are different. Red flag, in my opinion!https://lnkd.in/gxSicdpjDelphi Developer ‚Äì TEKsystems, supposedly hiring for positions in Okemos and Chicago, so 2 listings. They don‚Äôt even have offices in Okemos (although they do in Lansing, nearby).https://lnkd.in/gSyFD2tdSr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Jobs via Dice The job is not on the Dice corporate site. I'm not even sure if ""Jobs via Dice"" is legit in itself.Devbytes Inc. is the supposed client. Its tech stack is Java, Python and Azure. Not Delphihttps://lnkd.in/gFdnj3BsThis one is tricky:Sr. Delphi Developer ‚Äì Tekgence Inc. The job is not listed on the corporate webpage, and Delphi isn‚Äôt in the tech stack for the software developer position that is listed. Interestingly, there is a contact email on the job posting with a Tekgence email, but the address isn't the same one on the corporate website (yes, I know, the recruiter can be working from home). They are a recruitment firm, but would they be putting out a job posting when the actual company that is looking for a new employee already has a job posting up? Maybe a recruiter reading this could answer this question?https://lnkd.in/gSfhbRvpAll of the research that we job seekers have to do to make sure a job posting is legit is tiring. I could think of a lot more productive things I could do with my time. Do better hashtag#LinkedIn, please!Stay safe out there!
