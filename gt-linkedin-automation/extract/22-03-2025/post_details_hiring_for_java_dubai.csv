Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this?

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure?

If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this?

The Dubai Metro, a state-of-the-art, automated rail system, with its Red and Green Lines, connects iconic landmarks like the Dubai Mall and Dubai International Airport. With modern amenities like Wi-Fi, CCTV security, and inclusive accessibility, it’s a symbol of sustainability and efficiency.Children’s curiosity and sense of adventure are gifts to be nurtured. Overindulgence in luxury should never stifle their desire to explore. Experiences like this metro journey offer vital life lessons, fostering adaptability and resilience. By embracing such opportunities, children gain the courage and understanding to thrive wherever life takes them. Through this simple ride, I hope to inspire my daughter's adventurous spirit while teaching her to value life's diverse tapestry.I will make her ‘RUF & TUF’ like Daddy like my princess Swara

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed.

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this?

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this?

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this?

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this?

Komal PorwalKomal Porwal,,"Why are Indian millionaires leaving the country for places like the UAE and Singapore? It's a growing trend that needs attention.High taxes, complex regulations, and the lure of a better lifestyle are just a few reasons. Even the sons and relatives of politicians are making similar moves. Countries like the UAE offer tax-friendly policies and a seamless business environment, making relocation an easy choice.But when wealthy individuals leave, it impacts India's economy. Their investments, job creation, and contributions to the GDP are invaluable.Losing this capital affects our growth and innovation.The government should consider simplifying tax policies, improving business conditions, and enhancing the quality of life to retain talent and wealth.What are your thoughts?

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

Despite having lived here for years, she’s yet to explore this marvel. The Dubai Metro, a state-of-the-art, automated rail system, with its Red and Green Lines, connects iconic landmarks like the Dubai Mall and Dubai International Airport. With modern amenities like Wi-Fi, CCTV security, and inclusive accessibility, it’s a symbol of sustainability and efficiency.Children’s curiosity and sense of adventure are gifts to be nurtured. Overindulgence in luxury should never stifle their desire to explore. Experiences like this metro journey offer vital life lessons, fostering adaptability and resilience. By embracing such opportunities, children gain the courage and understanding to thrive wherever life takes them. Through this simple ride, I hope to inspire my daughter's adventurous spirit while teaching her to value life's diverse tapestry.I will make her ‘RUF & TUF’ like Daddy like my princess Swara

Countries like the UAE offer tax-friendly policies and a seamless business environment, making relocation an easy choice.But when wealthy individuals leave, it impacts India's economy. Their investments, job creation, and contributions to the GDP are invaluable.Losing this capital affects our growth and innovation.The government should consider simplifying tax policies, improving business conditions, and enhancing the quality of life to retain talent and wealth.What are your thoughts?

Jobs are only given to HR's relatives and acquaintances.In the past six months, I have applied for various job positions that perfectly matched my expertise. Yet, I either received no response from the company or got a generic email saying that the vacancy was filled.Most recently, on March 16, I had an interview for the role of Curious Junior Mentor. The interview went well because I have 12 years of experience in the education sector, including 5 years in edtech. I have worked with Unacademy and BYJU'S, so I am well-versed in this industry.Coming back to the story, I had my second-round interview on March 18. That also went well—I provided a demo using a pen tab, and everything seemed to go smoothly. But then, as expected, there was no update or confirmation from their side. When I messaged the HR team today (March 21), I received the same generic response: ""We did not find you fit for the role.""So, to anyone who doesn’t have connections within the HR or hiring team—please don’t waste your time applying to Physics Wallah.And to the founders of the company, I sincerely request you to pay attention to this rigged hiring process.Abhishek Jain @Subhangi Arora shrankhla.paliwal@pw.livepayalparthiyal@pw.livenavya.sharma1@pw.live

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

Ignoring Credit Card BenefitsDubai banks offer exclusive credit card perks like free airport lounge access, cashback, and travel rewards.

Despite having lived here for years, she’s yet to explore this marvel. The Dubai Metro, a state-of-the-art, automated rail system, with its Red and Green Lines, connects iconic landmarks like the Dubai Mall and Dubai International Airport. With modern amenities like Wi-Fi, CCTV security, and inclusive accessibility, it’s a symbol of sustainability and efficiency.Children’s curiosity and sense of adventure are gifts to be nurtured. Overindulgence in luxury should never stifle their desire to explore. Experiences like this metro journey offer vital life lessons, fostering adaptability and resilience. By embracing such opportunities, children gain the courage and understanding to thrive wherever life takes them. Through this simple ride, I hope to inspire my daughter's adventurous spirit while teaching her to value life's diverse tapestry.I will make her ‘RUF & TUF’ like Daddy like my princess Swara

Countries like the UAE offer tax-friendly policies and a seamless business environment, making relocation an easy choice.But when wealthy individuals leave, it impacts India's economy. Their investments, job creation, and contributions to the GDP are invaluable.Losing this capital affects our growth and innovation.The government should consider simplifying tax policies, improving business conditions, and enhancing the quality of life to retain talent and wealth.What are your thoughts?

The hiring at Physics Wallah is rigged—no matter how talented you are or how strong your past work experience is, you won’t get the job. Jobs are only given to HR's relatives and acquaintances.In the past six months, I have applied for various job positions that perfectly matched my expertise. Yet, I either received no response from the company or got a generic email saying that the vacancy was filled.Most recently, on March 16, I had an interview for the role of Curious Junior Mentor. The interview went well because I have 12 years of experience in the education sector, including 5 years in edtech. I have worked with Unacademy and BYJU'S, so I am well-versed in this industry.Coming back to the story, I had my second-round interview on March 18. That also went well—I provided a demo using a pen tab, and everything seemed to go smoothly. But then, as expected, there was no update or confirmation from their side. When I messaged the HR team today (March 21), I received the same generic response: ""We did not find you fit for the role.""So, to anyone who doesn’t have connections within the HR or hiring team—please don’t waste your time applying to Physics Wallah.And to the founders of the company, I sincerely request you to pay attention to this rigged hiring process.Abhishek Jain @Subhangi Arora shrankhla.paliwal@pw.livepayalparthiyal@pw.livenavya.sharma1@pw.live

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

Ignoring Credit Card BenefitsDubai banks offer exclusive credit card perks like free airport lounge access, cashback, and travel rewards.

Despite having lived here for years, she’s yet to explore this marvel. The Dubai Metro, a state-of-the-art, automated rail system, with its Red and Green Lines, connects iconic landmarks like the Dubai Mall and Dubai International Airport. With modern amenities like Wi-Fi, CCTV security, and inclusive accessibility, it’s a symbol of sustainability and efficiency.Children’s curiosity and sense of adventure are gifts to be nurtured. Overindulgence in luxury should never stifle their desire to explore. Experiences like this metro journey offer vital life lessons, fostering adaptability and resilience. By embracing such opportunities, children gain the courage and understanding to thrive wherever life takes them.

The hiring at Physics Wallah is rigged—no matter how talented you are or how strong your past work experience is, you won’t get the job. Jobs are only given to HR's relatives and acquaintances.In the past six months, I have applied for various job positions that perfectly matched my expertise. Yet, I either received no response from the company or got a generic email saying that the vacancy was filled.Most recently, on March 16, I had an interview for the role of Curious Junior Mentor. The interview went well because I have 12 years of experience in the education sector, including 5 years in edtech. I have worked with Unacademy and BYJU'S, so I am well-versed in this industry.Coming back to the story, I had my second-round interview on March 18. That also went well—I provided a demo using a pen tab, and everything seemed to go smoothly. But then, as expected, there was no update or confirmation from their side. When I messaged the HR team today (March 21), I received the same generic response: ""We did not find you fit for the role.""So, to anyone who doesn’t have connections within the HR or hiring team—please don’t waste your time applying to Physics Wallah.And to the founders of the company, I sincerely request you to pay attention to this rigged hiring process.Abhishek Jain @Subhangi Arora shrankhla.paliwal@pw.livepayalparthiyal@pw.livenavya.sharma1@pw.live

When it comes to hiring next-level developers, how can you find the right people who will make a difference when you yourself are not a senior engineer? I mean, if you needed to send a team of astronauts into space for something that would save all humanity, who would you ask to help you put together that team of astronauts? A recruiter? No. Probably an ex-astronaut who knows to ask something lifesavingly relevant like “what’s the meeting point of titanium?!” Ok maybe that’s all science fiction on my part. But the pain is real for both sides of the hiring equation.I feel very fortunate to have met this team I started working with recently: A team of three exceptional founders who have extensive experience in MAANG environments. If you or anyone you know are a Dev person getting ghosted by recruiters; or one who is transitioning to that next senior dream role, join the limited cohort. 7 Devs 3 SDETs — last I checked I think they only need 5 more Devs to kick off.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

Jobs are only given to HR's relatives and acquaintances.In the past six months, I have applied for various job positions that perfectly matched my expertise. Yet, I either received no response from the company or got a generic email saying that the vacancy was filled.Most recently, on March 16, I had an interview for the role of Curious Junior Mentor. The interview went well because I have 12 years of experience in the education sector, including 5 years in edtech. I have worked with Unacademy and BYJU'S, so I am well-versed in this industry.Coming back to the story, I had my second-round interview on March 18. That also went well—I provided a demo using a pen tab, and everything seemed to go smoothly. But then, as expected, there was no update or confirmation from their side. When I messaged the HR team today (March 21), I received the same generic response: ""We did not find you fit for the role.""So, to anyone who doesn’t have connections within the HR or hiring team—please don’t waste your time applying to Physics Wallah.And to the founders of the company, I sincerely request you to pay attention to this rigged hiring process.Abhishek Jain @Subhangi Arora shrankhla.paliwal@pw.livepayalparthiyal@pw.livenavya.sharma1@pw.live

When it comes to hiring next-level developers, how can you find the right people who will make a difference when you yourself are not a senior engineer? I mean, if you needed to send a team of astronauts into space for something that would save all humanity, who would you ask to help you put together that team of astronauts? A recruiter? No. Probably an ex-astronaut who knows to ask something lifesavingly relevant like “what’s the meeting point of titanium?!” Ok maybe that’s all science fiction on my part. But the pain is real for both sides of the hiring equation.I feel very fortunate to have met this team I started working with recently: A team of three exceptional founders who have extensive experience in MAANG environments. If you or anyone you know are a Dev person getting ghosted by recruiters; or one who is transitioning to that next senior dream role, join the limited cohort. 7 Devs 3 SDETs — last I checked I think they only need 5 more Devs to kick off.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

The interview went well because I have 12 years of experience in the education sector, including 5 years in edtech. I have worked with Unacademy and BYJU'S, so I am well-versed in this industry.Coming back to the story, I had my second-round interview on March 18. That also went well—I provided a demo using a pen tab, and everything seemed to go smoothly. But then, as expected, there was no update or confirmation from their side. When I messaged the HR team today (March 21), I received the same generic response: ""We did not find you fit for the role.""So, to anyone who doesn’t have connections within the HR or hiring team—please don’t waste your time applying to Physics Wallah.And to the founders of the company, I sincerely request you to pay attention to this rigged hiring process.Abhishek Jain @Subhangi Arora shrankhla.paliwal@pw.livepayalparthiyal@pw.livenavya.sharma1@pw.live

When it comes to hiring next-level developers, how can you find the right people who will make a difference when you yourself are not a senior engineer? I mean, if you needed to send a team of astronauts into space for something that would save all humanity, who would you ask to help you put together that team of astronauts? A recruiter? No. Probably an ex-astronaut who knows to ask something lifesavingly relevant like “what’s the meeting point of titanium?!” Ok maybe that’s all science fiction on my part. But the pain is real for both sides of the hiring equation.I feel very fortunate to have met this team I started working with recently: A team of three exceptional founders who have extensive experience in MAANG environments. If you or anyone you know are a Dev person getting ghosted by recruiters; or one who is transitioning to that next senior dream role, join the limited cohort. 7 Devs 3 SDETs — last I checked I think they only need 5 more Devs to kick off.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

The interview went well because I have 12 years of experience in the education sector, including 5 years in edtech. I have worked with Unacademy and BYJU'S, so I am well-versed in this industry.Coming back to the story, I had my second-round interview on March 18. That also went well—I provided a demo using a pen tab, and everything seemed to go smoothly. But then, as expected, there was no update or confirmation from their side. When I messaged the HR team today (March 21), I received the same generic response: ""We did not find you fit for the role.""So, to anyone who doesn’t have connections within the HR or hiring team—please don’t waste your time applying to Physics Wallah.And to the founders of the company, I sincerely request you to pay attention to this rigged hiring process.Abhishek Jain @Subhangi Arora shrankhla.paliwal@pw.livepayalparthiyal@pw.livenavya.sharma1@pw.live

When it comes to hiring next-level developers, how can you find the right people who will make a difference when you yourself are not a senior engineer? I mean, if you needed to send a team of astronauts into space for something that would save all humanity, who would you ask to help you put together that team of astronauts? A recruiter? No. Probably an ex-astronaut who knows to ask something lifesavingly relevant like “what’s the meeting point of titanium?!” Ok maybe that’s all science fiction on my part. But the pain is real for both sides of the hiring equation.I feel very fortunate to have met this team I started working with recently: A team of three exceptional founders who have extensive experience in MAANG environments. If you or anyone you know are a Dev person getting ghosted by recruiters; or one who is transitioning to that next senior dream role, join the limited cohort. 7 Devs 3 SDETs — last I checked I think they only need 5 more Devs to kick off.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

Michael MuoghaluMichael Muoghalu,,"Dubai Financial Services Authority Launches Tokenization RegulatoryDubai will always be known for its ability to adapt and adopt great innovations to enable them to move forward.And if you ask me, I'd say they made the right choice giving tokenization a chance to change things around the real estate industry in Dubai.Having experience working with a few real estate professionals in Dubai, I know this will go a long way for them.The Dubai Land Department (DLD) just launched a Real Estate Tokenization Pilot Program, making it the first real estate registry department in the Middle East to regulate ownership titles on a blockchain.By 2033, DLD expects tokenized real estate to account for 7% of all property transactions in Dubai — that’s 60 billion dirhams ($16B) in tokenized property deals.This move isn’t just about tokenization, it’s about unlocking new market opportunities: ✅ Lower barriers to entry for investors ✅ Increased liquidity and faster settlements ✅ Transparent ownership backed by blockchainUnlike traditional real estate models, tokenization creates a structured ownership system — giving investors more control and security.Marwan Ahmed Bin Ghalita, Director General of DLD, put it perfectly: ""This initiative will simplify and enhance buying, selling, and investment processes.""Dubai is once again showing why it’s a global leader in innovation. If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this? Are we about to see a major shift in real estate investment? 👇if you enjoy this post; like, comment, and share to spread the word!

Despite having lived here for years, she’s yet to explore this marvel. The Dubai Metro, a state-of-the-art, automated rail system, with its Red and Green Lines, connects iconic landmarks like the Dubai Mall and Dubai International Airport. With modern amenities like Wi-Fi, CCTV security, and inclusive accessibility, it’s a symbol of sustainability and efficiency.Children’s curiosity and sense of adventure are gifts to be nurtured. Overindulgence in luxury should never stifle their desire to explore. Experiences like this metro journey offer vital life lessons, fostering adaptability and resilience. By embracing such opportunities, children gain the courage and understanding to thrive wherever life takes them.

Countries like the UAE offer tax-friendly policies and a seamless business environment, making relocation an easy choice.But when wealthy individuals leave, it impacts India's economy. Their investments, job creation, and contributions to the GDP are invaluable.Losing this capital affects our growth and innovation.The government should consider simplifying tax policies, improving business conditions, and enhancing the quality of life to retain talent and wealth.What are your thoughts?

The interview went well because I have 12 years of experience in the education sector, including 5 years in edtech. I have worked with Unacademy and BYJU'S, so I am well-versed in this industry.Coming back to the story, I had my second-round interview on March 18. That also went well—I provided a demo using a pen tab, and everything seemed to go smoothly. But then, as expected, there was no update or confirmation from their side. When I messaged the HR team today (March 21), I received the same generic response: ""We did not find you fit for the role.""So, to anyone who doesn’t have connections within the HR or hiring team—please don’t waste your time applying to Physics Wallah.And to the founders of the company, I sincerely request you to pay attention to this rigged hiring process.Abhishek Jain @Subhangi Arora shrankhla.paliwal@pw.livepayalparthiyal@pw.livenavya.sharma1@pw.live

Kristina M.Kristina M.,,"Hiring is broken. AI is not helping. When it comes to hiring next-level developers, how can you find the right people who will make a difference when you yourself are not a senior engineer? I mean, if you needed to send a team of astronauts into space for something that would save all humanity, who would you ask to help you put together that team of astronauts? A recruiter? No. Probably an ex-astronaut who knows to ask something lifesavingly relevant like “what’s the meeting point of titanium?!” Ok maybe that’s all science fiction on my part. But the pain is real for both sides of the hiring equation.I feel very fortunate to have met this team I started working with recently: A team of three exceptional founders who have extensive experience in MAANG environments. If you or anyone you know are a Dev person getting ghosted by recruiters; or one who is transitioning to that next senior dream role, join the limited cohort. 7 Devs 3 SDETs — last I checked I think they only need 5 more Devs to kick off.

In our discussion, we explored how businesses are adapting to rapid change - from interest rate dynamics to geopolitical shifts. I remain optimistic about the UAE's position in this changing landscape, particularly given its commitment to sound regulation, peace, and open trade relationships.On the technology front, I emphasized that the AI revolution is only just beginning to impact our lives. When you're at the cutting edge of AI and digitalization, consulting and tech firms can help in certain areas, but the real work of pioneering, implementing, and sustaining AI must be owned by the business itself.

Mohamed DarwishMohamed Darwish,,"الحكم الصادر عن محكمة التمييز في أبوظبي في الطعن رقم ١٥٨ لسنة ٢٠٢٥ تجاري أرسى مبدأً قانونيًا هامًا بشأن التفرقة بين غرامة التأخير والتعويض عن عدم التنفيذ في عقود المقاولة. حيث أكدت المحكمة أن غرامة التأخير لا تُستحق إلا إذا تم تنفيذ المشروع بالكامل مع وجود تأخير في التسليم، أما في حالة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ، سواء بعدم استكمال الأعمال أو تنفيذ جزء منها فقط، فلا محل لغرامة التأخير، وإنما يكون التعويض هو الحل القانوني، شريطة إثبات الضرر الفعلي.وقد استندت المحكمة في ذلك إلى المادتين ٢٧٢ و٣٨٩ من قانون المعاملات المدنية الإماراتي، حيث تشترط الأولى تحقق الضرر لاستحقاق التعويض، بينما تمنح الثانية المحكمة سلطة تقديرية في تقدير قيمته وفقًا للضرر الفعلي اللاحق بصاحب العمل.ويعزز هذا المبدأ التوازن العقدي بين أطراف المقاولة، حيث يحول دون فرض التزامات غير مبررة على المقاول، مع ضمان حماية حقوق صاحب العمل في التعويض عن الأضرار التي تلحق به نتيجة الإخلال الجوهري بالتنفيذ.The judgment issued by the Court of Cassation in Abu Dhabi in Appeal No. 158 of 2025 Commercial established an important legal principle regarding the distinction between the delay penalty and compensation for non-execution in contracting contracts. Where the court confirmed that the delay fine is only due if the project is fully implemented with a delay in delivery, but in the case of a fundamental breach of implementation, whether by not completing the works or implementing only part of it, there is no place for the delay fine, but compensation is the legal solution, provided that the actual damage is proven.The court relied on Articles 272 and 389 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, where the first requires damage to be achieved for the entitlement to compensation, while the second gives the court discretion to estimate its value according to the actual damage to the employer.This principle reinforces the contractual balance between the contracting parties, as it prevents the imposition of unjustified obligations on the contractor, while ensuring the protection of the employer's rights to compensation for damages caused to him as a result of a fundamental breach of execution.

Saeed ShahSaeed Shah,,"In Pakistan, the property buying process can be lengthy due to extensive legal checks and documentation requirements. In contrast, Dubai offers a more secure system by mandating escrow accounts, which protect buyers’ funds during transactions. 💳 What is an Escrow Account?An escrow account is a third-party financial account where the buyer’s money is safely held until the developer meets construction milestones. This prevents fraud and ensures timely project completion. Dubai mandates escrow accounts, making real estate investment much safer than in many other countries.🏙️ Why Bahria Town in Dubai?✅ Prime Location – Close to the world’s largest airport✅ Lowest Price Per Sq.

Muhammad UmaisMuhammad Umais,,"Wanted to share some insights with you guys. Where Does $1M Go the Furthest in Your Real Estate Investment Career?💰When it comes to global cities, Dubai stands out for offering the most space for your money. Here's a quick comparison of how much space you get in top-tier cities as you can see in the shared Graph ( Dubai Stand Out ) .📍 Dubai – 1,130 sq. ft. 🚀That's 3x-6x more space than in major global financial hubs! But in Dubai, where you invest matters just as much as the space you get. Let’s dive into Off-Plan vs Secondary investments.🏗️ Off-Plan (New Developments):💰 Lock in today’s price with flexible payment plans.📈 Property appreciates by 30-40% by handover (usually 3 years).📆 After completion, it appreciates 7-10% annually.💵 Start earning 7-8% rental yield once the property is ready.🏡 Secondary Market (Ready Properties):💵 Immediate rental income (7% annual yield).📉 More stable, but lower capital appreciation (5-7% per year).💸 Higher upfront costs and possible maintenance expenses.💡 A Working Example: Off-Plan vs Secondary Scenario 1: Off-Plan Investment ($1M)✅ $600K paid over 3 years (60% during construction).💥 Property value increases to $1.35M (35% rise) by completion.✅ Final $400K payment upon handover.📈 Post-handover, property appreciates 7-10% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.9M - $2.3M💵 Total Rental Income (Years 4-7): ~$400K💥 Total Value: $2.3M - $2.7M (2.3x-2.7x return) Scenario 2: Secondary Market ($1M Ready Property)✅ 100% upfront payment.💸 Start earning $70K per year in rental income (7%).📈 Property appreciates at 5-7% annually.After 7 years:📊 Property Value: ~$1.4M - $1.6M💵 Total Rental Income: ~$490K💥 Total Value: $1.9M - $2.1M (1.9x-2.1x return)📌 Key Takeaways:🔑 Off-Plan requires less upfront capital (only 60% during construction).📈 Off-Plan offers higher capital growth in the long run (up to 2.7x return vs 2.1x).🏡 Secondary provides immediate cash flow but lower appreciation.🚀 The Winner?The Off-Plan investment grows faster, needs less upfront capital, and provides a higher-value asset once completed. Still not sure? Do checkout the DXBInteract website & my fellow consultants suggestions all over Linkedin ....Dubai isn’t just affordable; it’s a strategic investment in a rapidly growing market.👉 Want more insights on the best real estate opportunities in Dubai?

If you’re in the real estate or RWA space, this is your signal the future is already here.What’s your take on this?

It's a growing trend that needs attention.High taxes, complex regulations, and the lure of a better lifestyle are just a few reasons. Even the sons and relatives of politicians are making similar moves. Countries like the UAE offer tax-friendly policies and a seamless business environment, making relocation an easy choice.But when wealthy individuals leave, it impacts India's economy. Their investments, job creation, and contributions to the GDP are invaluable.Losing this capital affects our growth and innovation.The government should consider simplifying tax policies, improving business conditions, and enhancing the quality of life to retain talent and wealth.What are your thoughts?

Scam alert! Rigged Hiring ! Rigged HiringPW (PhysicsWallah) PW (PhysicsWallah) Physichswallah's hiring process is a fraud. Please don't waste your time applying for jobs here. The hiring at Physics Wallah is rigged—no matter how talented you are or how strong your past work experience is, you won’t get the job. Jobs are only given to HR's relatives and acquaintances.In the past six months, I have applied for various job positions that perfectly matched my expertise. Yet, I either received no response from the company or got a generic email saying that the vacancy was filled.Most recently, on March 16, I had an interview for the role of Curious Junior Mentor. The interview went well because I have 12 years of experience in the education sector, including 5 years in edtech. I have worked with Unacademy and BYJU'S, so I am well-versed in this industry.Coming back to the story, I had my second-round interview on March 18. That also went well—I provided a demo using a pen tab, and everything seemed to go smoothly. But then, as expected, there was no update or confirmation from their side. When I messaged the HR team today (March 21), I received the same generic response: ""We did not find you fit for the role.""So, to anyone who doesn’t have connections within the HR or hiring team—please don’t waste your time applying to Physics Wallah.And to the founders of the company, I sincerely request you to pay attention to this rigged hiring process.Abhishek Jain @Subhangi Arora shrankhla.paliwal@pw.livepayalparthiyal@pw.livenavya.sharma1@pw.live

Kristina M.Kristina M.,,"Hiring is broken. AI is not helping. When it comes to hiring next-level developers, how can you find the right people who will make a difference when you yourself are not a senior engineer? I mean, if you needed to send a team of astronauts into space for something that would save all humanity, who would you ask to help you put together that team of astronauts? A recruiter? No. Probably an ex-astronaut who knows to ask something lifesavingly relevant like “what’s the meeting point of titanium?!” Ok maybe that’s all science fiction on my part. But the pain is real for both sides of the hiring equation.I feel very fortunate to have met this team I started working with recently: A team of three exceptional founders who have extensive experience in MAANG environments. If you or anyone you know are a Dev person getting ghosted by recruiters; or one who is transitioning to that next senior dream role, join the limited cohort. 7 Devs 3 SDETs — last I checked I think they only need 5 more Devs to kick off.
