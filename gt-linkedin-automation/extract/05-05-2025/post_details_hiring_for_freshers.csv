Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration

Gunjan GuptaGunjan Gupta,,"As an entrepreneur, one thing that I have learned is, hiring is a crucial part of running any business. I too have learned from my mistakes and here's my cheat sheet for hiring for any business✔️ Hiring in hurry- Nothing hurts your business like hiring the wrong candidate in a hurry. Take your time whilst building your team✔️ Soft skills matter- Although soft skills like communication, adaptability, and teamwork look trivial but they matter the most in the long run. ✔️One-man army- Always involve your team in the hiring process. Being a one-man army can yield severe consequences. ✔️ Ignoring the red 🚩- Trust your experience and intuition equally. If you smell something fishy stop right there. ✔️Overlooking company culture- Skills can be taught but values come naturally. ✔️Confusing job description- Keep your JD crisp and short. A clear JD attracts the right candidate✔️Finding the ""right"" fit- Perfect candidates don't exist so stop wasting your time and resources. ✔️ Valuing experience way too much- Experience is invaluable but freshers bring new perspectives. Be fair to all the applicants✔️Continuous communication- Keep your communication open for regular feedbackhashtag#gunjann hashtag#digitalmarketing hashtag#sales hashtag#leads hashtag#leadsgeneration
