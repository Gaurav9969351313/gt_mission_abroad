Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational

Kamlesh MeghwalKamlesh Meghwal,,"What are two important engineering profiles¬†according to meHiring engineers is never easy, no matter the size or stage of your company. You're always looking for someone with the right skill set, mindset, and ability to execute fast. Getting a backend engineer to join on time, without ghosting or window-shopping around, honestly feels like a blessing these days.But while we obsess over finding the best frontend/backend/AI engineers, we often forget the unsung heroes who quietly keep our systems running and our users happy.1] QA- Gatekeeper for any feature release. QA isn't just about ""finding bugs."" A great QA engineer ensures your product doesn't go into the wild half-baked. They think like your users, break things before your customers do, and help you sleep better at night after a big release.- They are the silent gatekeepers who hold the line between ""it works on my machine"" and ""it works in the real world."" 2] DevOps- While developers are still debating whether it‚Äôs a bug or a feature, your DevOps are already scaling the servers, fixing broken pipelines, and rolling back bad deploys without drama.- They automate the boring, secure the risky, and make sure the app is fast, stable, and always available.These roles are often seen as ""easily replaceable"" or ""non-core engineering"" when they are, in fact, absolutely foundational. Companies who recognise and invest in great QA and DevOps talent end up shipping faster, with higher quality, and fewer surprises in production.hashtag#engineering hashtag#hiring hashtag#QA hashtag#Devops hashtag#security hashtag#development hashtag#developer hashtag#engineer hashtag#server hashtag#backend hashtag#frontend hashtag#foundational
