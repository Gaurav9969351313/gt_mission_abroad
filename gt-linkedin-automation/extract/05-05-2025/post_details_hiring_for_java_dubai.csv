You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Now they mean momentum.At this year’s ATM, I was reconnecting with minds building cities, reimagining travel, shaping experience, and investing in innovation. These relationships aren’t new. They’re nurtured.I caught up with some powerful minds I’ve long respected: @Haussain alblooshi Dubai Holding @Mohammed Sarhan Emirates @ Brigadier General Dubai Police  Denys Hryvas, Sam Stephen Miral Miral Experiences and @ ZohaibSiwani Seven (reunion), Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism Mobin Philips flydubai teamLab Inc. Netflix featured Entrepreneur @Ebraheem al samadi @Andre – Start Reverse at Rove Hotels Shazia Ahmed - Emaar Hospitality Group And as I reflected on every handshake, every 5-minute strategy chat, every knowing glance between builders and believers, a truth sharpened:𝙒𝙚’𝙧𝙚 𝙣𝙤𝙩 𝙟𝙪𝙨𝙩 𝙗𝙪𝙞𝙡𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙖𝙣𝙞𝙚𝙨. 𝙒𝙚’𝙧𝙚 𝙨𝙝𝙖𝙥𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙨𝙮𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙢𝙨.Today’s HR leaders are expected to wear multiple lenses—financial fluency, emotional range, operational precision, brand intuition.Not because it sounds impressive, but because business demands it.In these rooms, I wasn’t “just HR.” I was:-> Reading talent signals-> Listening beneath headlines-> Linking mindset to market movementBecause that’s what I do:Whether it’s helping a company scale across borders, or defining the heartbeat of a brand from the inside out—I don’t just work with people. I work through them to unlock velocity.Because business today moves through people.As i continue to focus on:-> Strategic hiring that aligns with long-term value-> Culture architecture that scales beyond buzzwords-> Real-time people insights that drive business velocityThese conversations reminded me:𝙍𝙚𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥𝙨 𝙖𝙧𝙚𝙣’𝙩 𝙖 𝙧𝙚𝙬𝙖𝙧𝙙—𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙮’𝙧𝙚 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙧𝙪𝙣𝙬𝙖𝙮.And here’s the truth every hashtag#Global HR Leader knows:In today’s business environment, talent strategy isn’t just about people—it’s about pattern recognition.𝙔𝙤𝙪 𝙢𝙪𝙨𝙩 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙙 𝙙𝙮𝙣𝙖𝙢𝙞𝙘𝙨 𝙡𝙞𝙠𝙚 𝙖 𝙛𝙤𝙪𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙧, 𝙡𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙣 𝙡𝙞𝙠𝙚 𝙖 𝙘𝙤𝙖𝙘𝙝, 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙢𝙤𝙫𝙚 𝙡𝙞𝙠𝙚 𝙖𝙣 𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙤𝙧.To everyone building, creating, and transforming—thank you for the inspiration.If your team is hiring, scaling, or simply stuck—let’s talk.Or better yet… drop a dm.hashtag#StrategicHR hashtag#ATM2025 hashtag#GlobalLeadership hashtag#PeoplePower hashtag#HRBusinessPartner hashtag#TransformationStartsHere hashtag#CultureShaping hashtag#ExecutiveSearch hashtag#MondayMomentum hashtag#UAELeadership hashtag#innovation hashtag#management hashtag#career hashtag#opportunity hashtag#hr hashtag#talent hashtag#learning hashtag#development hashtag#coaching hashtag#India hashtag#uae hashtag#Dubai hashtag#abudbhai hashtag#gcc hashtag#global Euphoria Consulting LinkedIn LinkedIn News LinkedIn Talent Solutions Arabian Travel Market

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

Diana Hamade Attorneys at LawDiana Hamade Attorneys at Law,,"Our 4th episode of hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk is out to be shared with you, if you have an interest in the subject of the divorce of Muslims in the UAE, applying UAE Federal Decree Law 41 of 2024on Personal Status matters.We discuss how Sharia allows a man to pronounce his No-Fault Divorce, his Talaq, and a woman to file for divorce or Khula, while the UAE Non Muslims Laws allow women and men the same right of No Fault Divorce, and grants compensation payable by the party who has caused the end of the marriage.Muslims Law is unfortunately void of any mention of compensation to be paid to the party who has suffered harm by the other party, allowing divorce without any  reprecussions.  To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Mousa Al RousanMousa Al Rousan,,"Prices Are Rising in Abu Dhabi... Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision. And in a city like Abu Dhabi, where growth is strategic and long-term, capitalizing on the right opportunity requires awareness and readiness, nothing more.Watch the video for more details on the projects I discussed, and real numbers that prove: those who invested yesterday are enjoying the returns today.

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Mousa Al RousanMousa Al Rousan,,"Prices Are Rising in Abu Dhabi... Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision. And in a city like Abu Dhabi, where growth is strategic and long-term, capitalizing on the right opportunity requires awareness and readiness, nothing more.Watch the video for more details on the projects I discussed, and real numbers that prove: those who invested yesterday are enjoying the returns today.

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Mousa Al RousanMousa Al Rousan,,"Prices Are Rising in Abu Dhabi... Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision. And in a city like Abu Dhabi, where growth is strategic and long-term, capitalizing on the right opportunity requires awareness and readiness, nothing more.Watch the video for more details on the projects I discussed, and real numbers that prove: those who invested yesterday are enjoying the returns today.

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

Diana Hamade Attorneys at LawDiana Hamade Attorneys at Law,,"Our 4th episode of hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk is out to be shared with you, if you have an interest in the subject of the divorce of Muslims in the UAE, applying UAE Federal Decree Law 41 of 2024on Personal Status matters.We discuss how Sharia allows a man to pronounce his No-Fault Divorce, his Talaq, and a woman to file for divorce or Khula, while the UAE Non Muslims Laws allow women and men the same right of No Fault Divorce, and grants compensation payable by the party who has caused the end of the marriage.Muslims Law is unfortunately void of any mention of compensation to be paid to the party who has suffered harm by the other party, allowing divorce without any  reprecussions.  To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Mousa Al RousanMousa Al Rousan,,"Prices Are Rising in Abu Dhabi... Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision.

Youssef DiabYoussef Diab,,"What Really Happens Before You Become a Law Firm Client in the UAE ?When a new client approaches a law firm, most people imagine the legal work starts with a consultation or drafting documents. But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Mousa Al RousanMousa Al Rousan,,"Prices Are Rising in Abu Dhabi... Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision.

Youssef DiabYoussef Diab,,"What Really Happens Before You Become a Law Firm Client in the UAE ?When a new client approaches a law firm, most people imagine the legal work starts with a consultation or drafting documents. But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time.

Youssef DiabYoussef Diab,,"What Really Happens Before You Become a Law Firm Client in the UAE ?When a new client approaches a law firm, most people imagine the legal work starts with a consultation or drafting documents. But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Mousa Al RousanMousa Al Rousan,,"Prices Are Rising in Abu Dhabi... Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision. And in a city like Abu Dhabi, where growth is strategic and long-term, capitalizing on the right opportunity requires awareness and readiness, nothing more.Watch the video for more details on the projects I discussed, and real numbers that prove: those who invested yesterday are enjoying the returns today.

Youssef DiabYoussef Diab,,"What Really Happens Before You Become a Law Firm Client in the UAE ?When a new client approaches a law firm, most people imagine the legal work starts with a consultation or drafting documents. But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision. And in a city like Abu Dhabi, where growth is strategic and long-term, capitalizing on the right opportunity requires awareness and readiness, nothing more.Watch the video for more details on the projects I discussed, and real numbers that prove: those who invested yesterday are enjoying the returns today.

But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Karina MeirmannKarina Meirmann,,"Dubai isn’t just laying roads — it’s laying the blueprint for the future.Backed by the bold vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, over AED 150B has been invested in the past 19 years to create a transport network that’s not just world-class — it’s world-leading.And this week, HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum doubled down on that mission, bringing together 100+ experts and 50+ global partners at the RTA’s ‘Connecting Bridges’ workshop — focused on solving urban challenges and future-proofing mobility.Some stats that speak for themselves:• 15,000+ km of infrastructure (roads, bridges, tunnels)• 747M+ public transport riders in 2024 — up 6.4% YoY• 2.4B+ cumulative metro riders since 2009• 92.3M passengers through DXB in 2024 — record-breaking• Vision 2030: 25% autonomous trips, 40% green fleetBut this isn’t just about infrastructure.It’s about velocity, vision, and value creation.Mobility fuels over 75% of Dubai’s non-oil GDP.Smart systems attract global FDI.And the D33 agenda? Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision.

But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot?

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision.

Youssef DiabYoussef Diab,,"What Really Happens Before You Become a Law Firm Client in the UAE ?When a new client approaches a law firm, most people imagine the legal work starts with a consultation or drafting documents. But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Growiieze Real Estate LLCGrowiieze Real Estate LLC,,"From Launch to Exit:How Dubai’s Best Projects Create Returns Before They’re Built— A Growiieze PerspectiveIn most markets, you buy. You wait. You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision. And in a city like Abu Dhabi, where growth is strategic and long-term, capitalizing on the right opportunity requires awareness and readiness, nothing more.Watch the video for more details on the projects I discussed, and real numbers that prove: those who invested yesterday are enjoying the returns today.

But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

Diana Hamade Attorneys at LawDiana Hamade Attorneys at Law,,"Our 4th episode of hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk is out to be shared with you, if you have an interest in the subject of the divorce of Muslims in the UAE, applying UAE Federal Decree Law 41 of 2024on Personal Status matters.We discuss how Sharia allows a man to pronounce his No-Fault Divorce, his Talaq, and a woman to file for divorce or Khula, while the UAE Non Muslims Laws allow women and men the same right of No Fault Divorce, and grants compensation payable by the party who has caused the end of the marriage.Muslims Law is unfortunately void of any mention of compensation to be paid to the party who has suffered harm by the other party, allowing divorce without any  reprecussions.  To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision. And in a city like Abu Dhabi, where growth is strategic and long-term, capitalizing on the right opportunity requires awareness and readiness, nothing more.Watch the video for more details on the projects I discussed, and real numbers that prove: those who invested yesterday are enjoying the returns today.

Youssef DiabYoussef Diab,,"What Really Happens Before You Become a Law Firm Client in the UAE ?When a new client approaches a law firm, most people imagine the legal work starts with a consultation or drafting documents. But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Karina MeirmannKarina Meirmann,,"Dubai isn’t just laying roads — it’s laying the blueprint for the future.Backed by the bold vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, over AED 150B has been invested in the past 19 years to create a transport network that’s not just world-class — it’s world-leading.And this week, HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum doubled down on that mission, bringing together 100+ experts and 50+ global partners at the RTA’s ‘Connecting Bridges’ workshop — focused on solving urban challenges and future-proofing mobility.Some stats that speak for themselves:• 15,000+ km of infrastructure (roads, bridges, tunnels)• 747M+ public transport riders in 2024 — up 6.4% YoY• 2.4B+ cumulative metro riders since 2009• 92.3M passengers through DXB in 2024 — record-breaking• Vision 2030: 25% autonomous trips, 40% green fleetBut this isn’t just about infrastructure.It’s about velocity, vision, and value creation.Mobility fuels over 75% of Dubai’s non-oil GDP.Smart systems attract global FDI.And the D33 agenda? Aiming for a AED 32 trillion economy by 2033.While others catch up, Dubai builds ahead — setting the pace with clean, connected, scalable systems designed for 2040 and beyond.This is strategic city-building — and real leadership in motion.Grateful to witness it, and even more proud to contribute to it.We’re nearing 10,000 followers — and it’s thanks to all of you.If this resonated, I’d appreciate you sharing my profile or this post with your network.Let’s keep building a space for high-level insights, bold thinking, and real conversations.hashtag#Dubai2030 hashtag#SmartMobility hashtag#D33Agenda hashtag#UrbanExcellence hashtag#VisionDriven hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#FutureOfCities hashtag#RTA hashtag#LeadershipInAction hashtag#MobilityMatters

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision.

But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Scott McMillanScott McMillan,,"The UAE’s education market is world-class but the next phase of growth won’t come from just premium facilities. It’ll come from operational readiness and purpose-built partnerships.After years working with schools across the UAE - whether international brands, charter networks, or new local entrants - one thing is clear: operational excellence is now a competitive differentiator. From “Day One”, whether it is a new school opening in Abu Dhabi, or a strategic repositioning in Dubai, success must align pedagogy, policy, and people.At Evolving Education we want to support school groups navigating everything from regulator approvals to talent management.Whether it’s managing timelines for first-day readiness or advising on market positioning, we understand how to move from vision to viable operation in a dynamic market like the UAE.If you’re launching or scaling a school in the UAE, ask yourself:* Are your operational decisions aligned with your educational value proposition?* Have you pressure-tested your readiness plan beyond construction and licensing?* Are you building a team culture that will actually sustain your enrolment promise?I’d welcome a conversation with other educators, investors, or operators who are planning for the next academic year. The opportunity in the UAE is massive, but only for those ready to execute at pace and with purpose!hashtag#UAEEducation hashtag#K12Leadership hashtag#SchoolOperations hashtag#EvolvingEducation hashtag#EducationStrategy hashtag#AbuDhabiSchools hashtag#DubaiEducation

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot?

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision. And in a city like Abu Dhabi, where growth is strategic and long-term, capitalizing on the right opportunity requires awareness and readiness, nothing more.Watch the video for more details on the projects I discussed, and real numbers that prove: those who invested yesterday are enjoying the returns today.

But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Scott McMillanScott McMillan,,"The UAE’s education market is world-class but the next phase of growth won’t come from just premium facilities. It’ll come from operational readiness and purpose-built partnerships.After years working with schools across the UAE - whether international brands, charter networks, or new local entrants - one thing is clear: operational excellence is now a competitive differentiator. From “Day One”, whether it is a new school opening in Abu Dhabi, or a strategic repositioning in Dubai, success must align pedagogy, policy, and people.At Evolving Education we want to support school groups navigating everything from regulator approvals to talent management.Whether it’s managing timelines for first-day readiness or advising on market positioning, we understand how to move from vision to viable operation in a dynamic market like the UAE.If you’re launching or scaling a school in the UAE, ask yourself:* Are your operational decisions aligned with your educational value proposition?* Have you pressure-tested your readiness plan beyond construction and licensing?* Are you building a team culture that will actually sustain your enrolment promise?I’d welcome a conversation with other educators, investors, or operators who are planning for the next academic year. The opportunity in the UAE is massive, but only for those ready to execute at pace and with purpose!hashtag#UAEEducation hashtag#K12Leadership hashtag#SchoolOperations hashtag#EvolvingEducation hashtag#EducationStrategy hashtag#AbuDhabiSchools hashtag#DubaiEducation

You exit.In Dubai, the smartest investors?They’re exiting before handover.Because in well-zoned, well-timed off-plan projects —value isn’t created at completion.It’s created during construction.Here’s how:• 📈 15%–35% Value Uplift Pre-HandoverTop-tier off-plan projects have seen capital appreciation from launch to handover ranging between 15%–35% — especially in low-density branded or community-based offerings.• ⏳ Exit Timeline: 14–28 MonthsInvestors are flipping during construction or just before handover — without ever furnishing or renting.It’s velocity, not holding, that defines this bracket.• 🧭 Supply Timing = ROI AccelerationThe sweet spot? Early phases in areas where infrastructure is 90% complete, but sentiment is still 60% priced in.• 🏗️ Developer Credibility = Exit PremiumsProjects from developers with clear delivery records + resale support ecosystems =Higher resale volume, faster assignments, and better buyer trust.• 🔒 Limited Supply, Locked-in PricingIn a market where new launches keep inflating, locked-in early bird pricing becomes its own asset.Investors are monetizing access, not just appreciation.Growiieze Final Thought:Dubai’s best real estate returns aren’t always made after handover.They’re made between the brochure and the balcony.Because when timing, product, and zone align —capital moves before the cranes stop.hashtag#GrowiiezePerspective hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#SmartInvestinghashtag#OffPlanReturns hashtag#CapitalVelocity hashtag#HNIStrategyhashtag#ROIInsights hashtag#BuiltWithPurpose hashtag#RealEstateLogichashtag#InvestorLens hashtag#Dubai2025 hashtag#AssetStackinghashtag#ExitBeforeHandover hashtag#GlobalCapitalFlow hashtag#GrowiiezeInsightshashtag#MiddleEastGrowth hashtag#PropertyInvestment hashtag#Dubai

Mentesenot KibebewMentesenot Kibebew,,"Hello, just prepared some notes for my Ethiopian Fellows who are looking for opportunities in UAE.This is just from my personal experience, not a professional guide but one common question I get is: “Should I come to Dubai to find a job or apply from Ethiopia?""Both options work. If you get hired from Ethiopia, your employer will process your employment visa which is ideal. But most interviews in Dubai happen face-to-face, so being here increases your chances of getting hired faster.The other thing to consider is looking for an intern or entry‑level hire as many Dubai companies will sponsor your work permit even if you have no local experience, and internships often convert into full‑time roles compared to mid-senior to senior positions as most of the companies require UAE experience. I highly suggest you to be active on LinkedIn, follow companies with the industry that aligns to you and message HR staff as the connection you build is highly valuable, even if you might not get a fast result in the long term it will highly benefits you in your career advancement.Make sure your cv is tailored and ATS friendly based on the job description and prepare a cover letter for each application (See this guide written by GulfTalent on how to prepare your cv https://lnkd.in/dyDituwF ).One important thing to keep in mind is the job market is competitive so it's better to have strong technical skills and Prepare a portfolio of your past work or projects. This helps you stand out and gives employers something concrete to review during interviews.Try to do a research about things like: Cost of living, Visa process and Company reputation once you start getting offers. Just a reminder NEVER PAY anyone that says ""we will provide you the job but you have pay for admin fee, visa fee or any other form of payment.These are sites commonly used for the job search here beyond the company portal:- https://www.linkedin.com/- https://ae.indeed.com/ - https://lnkd.in/d2D-PXAd- https://lnkd.in/drzMFAvz- https://lnkd.in/dQZuhvnyBeyond the above job portals focus on the company's portal as well as some applications require a detailed application process, they upload it on their career page.Hope this helps someone out there maybe I will add some additional guide. Feel free to share, comment, or message me if you have questions and I will try to answer them.

Diana Hamade Attorneys at LawDiana Hamade Attorneys at Law,,"Our 4th episode of hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk is out to be shared with you, if you have an interest in the subject of the divorce of Muslims in the UAE, applying UAE Federal Decree Law 41 of 2024on Personal Status matters.We discuss how Sharia allows a man to pronounce his No-Fault Divorce, his Talaq, and a woman to file for divorce or Khula, while the UAE Non Muslims Laws allow women and men the same right of No Fault Divorce, and grants compensation payable by the party who has caused the end of the marriage.Muslims Law is unfortunately void of any mention of compensation to be paid to the party who has suffered harm by the other party, allowing divorce without any  reprecussions.  To watch the episode please visit the YouTube link below.https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xwالحلقة الرابعة من hashtag#Psych_Legal_Talk أصبحت متاحة الآن!في هذه الحلقة، نغوص في موضوع طلاق المسلمين في قانون دولة الإمارات، وخاصة في ضوء المرسوم بقانون اتحادي رقم 41 لسنة 2024 بشأن الأحوال الشخصية.تجيز الشريعة للرجل المسلم إصدار الطلاق بدون إثبات ضرر أو سبب (الطلاق التعسفي)، بينما تمنح قوانين الإمارات الخاصة بغير المسلمين الحق المتساوي للرجال والنساء في طلب الطلاق بدون خطأ، كما تُتيح تعويضاً مالياً للطرف المتضرر من انهيار العلاقة الزوجية.لكن و الأسف فإن قانون الأحوال الشخصية للمسلمين في الإمارات لا يتضمن حالياً أي نصوص تتعلق بتعويض الطرف المتضرر، مما يعرض مؤسسة الزواج للانتهاك و عدم التقدير.تابعونا بينما نستعرض الأبعاد القانونية والنفسية والاجتماعية لهذه القضية.امشاهدة الحلقة على اليوتيوب الرجاء الضغط على الرابط https://lnkd.in/dhRSP5xw

Ali BoujtatAli Boujtat,,"Dubai's population boom is creating unprecedented real estate opportunities for investors. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, the city welcomed nearly 90,000 new residents, equating to almost 1,000 individuals daily. This surge in population isn't merely a statistic; it's a clear indicator of escalating demand for housing, infrastructure, and commercial properties that surpasses all expectations.For investors, this surge signifies an ideal moment to establish a presence in a market where various sectors are experiencing remarkable growth:- Apartment prices have risen by 20% year-on-year- Villa prices have seen a significant surge of 29%- Office rents have escalated by over 20%- Residential rents are steadily increasingAlthough there is an anticipated influx of over 61,000 new units in 2025, the existing demand levels suggest that this supply may not be adequate to rebalance the market dynamics. For those with a long-term investment perspective, it's crucial to note that Dubai is not just attracting residents but also talent, capital, and businesses. The rapid population growth forms the cornerstone of real estate value, and in Dubai, this growth is occurring at an unprecedented pace.If you are considering transforming these statistics into profitable returns, let's engage in a conversation.

Rehan AllahwalaRehan Allahwala,,"UAE Breaks Global Barriers: Introducing the World’s Boldest AI Education Revolution for Future GenerationsIn a move that places the UAE firmly at the forefront of global innovation, the government has officially approved the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a mandatory subject across all public schools from kindergarten to grade 12 starting with the 2025–2026 academic year.Let’s break this down:Global AI Landscape: Where the World Stands1. The global AI market is projected to soar from $207 billion (2023) to over $1.85 trillion by 2030 2. PwC forecasts AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 more than the combined GDP of China and India today.3. Yet fewer than 11 countries worldwide currently have government-endorsed K-12 AI curricula (UNESCO, 2024), putting the UAE at the very top of global innovators.The Workforce Revolution:• The World Economic Forum’s 2025 Future of Jobs Report projects:1. 170 million new jobs will be created globally by 2030.2. 92 million jobs will be displaced.3. Net gain: 78 million new roles many of them requiring advanced digital and AI-related skills.• Employers estimate 39% of workers core skills will change by 2030, underscoring the urgency of early, system-wide reskilling.UAE’s AI Strategy 2031:• Boost AI’s share of national GDP by 14% (≈AED 335–352 billion).• Embed AI across priority sectors: healthcare, transportation, climate, renewable energy, and education.• Rank among the world’s top 10 in AI innovation, governance, and testing.• Expand the digital economy’s non-oil GDP share from 11.7% to 20% by the early 2030s.What Makes the UAE’s Curriculum Unique?This isn’t just about teaching kids to code.It’s about:1. Deep understanding of data, algorithms, and ethical frameworks.2. Raising awareness of AI’s societal risks, biases, and transformative power.3. Equipping youth to become creators, regulators, and global innovators not passive tech consumers.Why the UAE Stands Alone GloballyWhere many advanced economies are still debating risks or running small-scale pilots, the UAE is:→ Institutionalizing AI literacy at scale.→ Building national, homegrown AI talent.→ Shaping international benchmarks for ethical, inclusive innovation.This aligns with the country’s boldest ambitions:1. UAE Centennial 2071 to be the best nation in the world by its centenary.2. Dubai Economic Agenda D33 to double the city’s economy in a decade.3. National Innovation Strategy with AI as a central pillar for growth.As HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum stated:“Our responsibility is to equip our children for a time unlike ours… with new skills and capabilities to ensure the continued momentum of development and progress in our nation for decades to come.”The UAE is not just preparing to participate in the global AI race it is setting the pace for the world to follow.

Mousa Al RousanMousa Al Rousan,,"Prices Are Rising in Abu Dhabi... Are You Ready to Seize the Opportunity?In recent years, the real estate market in Abu Dhabi has witnessed a significant surge in property prices. It’s clear that the market is in a phase of rapid growth, driven by several factors including continuous infrastructure development, strong government investment, and increasing demand for modern, integrated living communities.In this video, I highlight a few projects in Abu Dhabi and showcase how property prices have changed over time. You’ll be surprised by the numbers: apartments that once sold for AED 2 million are now valued at over AED 6 million. Villas that were priced at AED 2.5 million are now going for AED 4 million.So, what does this mean for you?Opportunities haven’t disappeared—they’re still here. The difference lies in knowing where to look, how to analyze the market, and when to act.Real estate investing isn’t about luck—it’s about vision.

Youssef DiabYoussef Diab,,"What Really Happens Before You Become a Law Firm Client in the UAE ?When a new client approaches a law firm, most people imagine the legal work starts with a consultation or drafting documents. But in reality, a lot happens behind the scenes before we ever say, ""How can we help you?""In my latest article, I share a real-world look at what UAE law firms (including myself as a legal professional) do before onboarding a new client. This includes:✅ KYC and AML due diligence – not just box-ticking, but real risk and identity screening ✅ Conflict-of-interest checks – because ethics matter as much as expertise ✅ Reputational and risk assessments – who we represent says a lot about who we are ✅ Clearly defining scope and fees – to avoid surprises down the road ✅ Formal engagement and internal approvals – ensuring everything is by the bookOnboarding isn't just admin work — it's a key part of protecting both the firm and the client. If you're in the legal industry, or even just curious about what happens before a lawyer takes your case, I think you'll find it insightful.hashtag#KYC hashtag#Compliance hashtag#AML hashtag#Lawfirms hashtag#Dubai hashtag#ConflictCheck

Scott McMillanScott McMillan,,"The UAE’s education market is world-class but the next phase of growth won’t come from just premium facilities. It’ll come from operational readiness and purpose-built partnerships.After years working with schools across the UAE - whether international brands, charter networks, or new local entrants - one thing is clear: operational excellence is now a competitive differentiator. From “Day One”, whether it is a new school opening in Abu Dhabi, or a strategic repositioning in Dubai, success must align pedagogy, policy, and people.At Evolving Education we want to support school groups navigating everything from regulator approvals to talent management.Whether it’s managing timelines for first-day readiness or advising on market positioning, we understand how to move from vision to viable operation in a dynamic market like the UAE.If you’re launching or scaling a school in the UAE, ask yourself:* Are your operational decisions aligned with your educational value proposition?* Have you pressure-tested your readiness plan beyond construction and licensing?* Are you building a team culture that will actually sustain your enrolment promise?I’d welcome a conversation with other educators, investors, or operators who are planning for the next academic year. The opportunity in the UAE is massive, but only for those ready to execute at pace and with purpose!hashtag#UAEEducation hashtag#K12Leadership hashtag#SchoolOperations hashtag#EvolvingEducation hashtag#EducationStrategy hashtag#AbuDhabiSchools hashtag#DubaiEducation

Harshwardhan S.Harshwardhan S.,,"Step into Dubai's Future: Unpacking the Vision 2040 Urban Master Plan ✨Dubai isn't just building for tomorrow; it's meticulously crafting a better tomorrow. The Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan isn't merely about expansion; it's a visionary blueprint centred entirely on enhancing the quality of life for everyone.Imagine a city designed around you. That's the heart of Vision 2040.Simplified, it’s about making Dubai the world's best city to live in by focusing on: * People & Well-being: Prioritizing residents' happiness and health. Think integrated communities where 80% of daily needs (work, shops, health, education, leisure) are accessible within a 20-minute sustainable journey (walk, cycle, transit). * Nature & Sustainability: Doubling green and recreational areas! Parks, nature reserves, and public beaches become even more integral, weaving a green lung through the urban landscape. Sustainability isn't an afterthought; it's the foundation. * Vibrant, Focused Growth: Developing distinct urban centres. Areas like Deira/Bur Dubai (heritage), Downtown/Business Bay (financial hub), Marina/JBR (tourism/entertainment), Expo 2020 Centre (events/logistics), and Silicon Oasis (knowledge/innovation) will be further enhanced. Plus, a special focus on developing the unique potential of areas like Hatta. * Economic Dynamism: Reinforcing Dubai's position as a global economic powerhouse by attracting diverse talent and investment into dynamic, future-focused sectors. * Heritage & Identity: While forging ahead, the plan ensures the preservation and celebration of Dubai's rich Emirati heritage and cultural identity.Vision 2040 represents a profound shift from rapid growth to smart, sustainable, human-centric development. It’s about creating a harmonious balance between urban life, nature, opportunity, and cultural roots. It’s less about building more, and more about building better, creating spaces where people truly thrive.This isn't just urban planning; it's a promise of a dynamic, resilient, inclusive, and enchanting future for Dubai. A compelling glimpse into what a people-first global city can look like! 🚀hashtag#Dubai2040 hashtag#UrbanPlanning hashtag#FutureCities hashtag#Sustainability hashtag#QualityOfLife hashtag#SmartCity hashtag#Dubai hashtag#UAE hashtag#Vision hashtag#Innovation hashtag#PeopleFirst
