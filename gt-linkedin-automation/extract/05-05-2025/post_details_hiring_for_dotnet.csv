Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt.

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly.

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Haroon KhokharHaroon Khokhar,,"Everyone wants to be a developer these days — especially in Pakistan. Why?Because tech roles offer better pay, faster growth, and global opportunities.💻📈🌍But here’s the hard truth:Most people only like the outcome, not the process.They dream of a high-paying job, remote work, and a laptop lifestyle —But they don't want to learn.They don’t compete.They don’t complete the journey.And when they don't land their first internship or job, they blame the job market or companies.❌ But the real problem?They only dreamed — they never prepared.The market isn't broken.Your mindset might be.If you really want to succeed as a developer, you have to:✅ Learn consistently✅ Build real projects✅ Compete with discipline✅ Never stop improvingEveryone wants to become a developer.But not everyone becomes one.Dreaming is the start —Doing is what makes it real.Work for your dreams.Or someone else will live them instead.⚒️💡hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#DeveloperJourney hashtag#PakistanTech hashtag#LearnToEarn hashtag#NoShortcuts hashtag#HardWorkPaysOff hashtag#InternshipHunt hashtag#FutureInTech hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#MindsetMatters

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt.

Why?Because tech roles offer better pay, faster growth, and global opportunities.💻📈🌍But here’s the hard truth:Most people only like the outcome, not the process.They dream of a high-paying job, remote work, and a laptop lifestyle —But they don't want to learn.They don’t compete.They don’t complete the journey.And when they don't land their first internship or job, they blame the job market or companies.❌ But the real problem?They only dreamed — they never prepared.The market isn't broken.Your mindset might be.If you really want to succeed as a developer, you have to:✅ Learn consistently✅ Build real projects✅ Compete with discipline✅ Never stop improvingEveryone wants to become a developer.But not everyone becomes one.Dreaming is the start —Doing is what makes it real.Work for your dreams.Or someone else will live them instead.⚒️💡hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#DeveloperJourney hashtag#PakistanTech hashtag#LearnToEarn hashtag#NoShortcuts hashtag#HardWorkPaysOff hashtag#InternshipHunt hashtag#FutureInTech hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#MindsetMatters

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt.

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Why?Because tech roles offer better pay, faster growth, and global opportunities.💻📈🌍But here’s the hard truth:Most people only like the outcome, not the process.They dream of a high-paying job, remote work, and a laptop lifestyle —But they don't want to learn.They don’t compete.They don’t complete the journey.And when they don't land their first internship or job, they blame the job market or companies.❌ But the real problem?They only dreamed — they never prepared.The market isn't broken.Your mindset might be.If you really want to succeed as a developer, you have to:✅ Learn consistently✅ Build real projects✅ Compete with discipline✅ Never stop improvingEveryone wants to become a developer.But not everyone becomes one.Dreaming is the start —Doing is what makes it real.Work for your dreams.Or someone else will live them instead.⚒️💡hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#DeveloperJourney hashtag#PakistanTech hashtag#LearnToEarn hashtag#NoShortcuts hashtag#HardWorkPaysOff hashtag#InternshipHunt hashtag#FutureInTech hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#MindsetMatters

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt.

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career? I’d love to hear your story.hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#SocialMediaManager hashtag#EntrepreneurJourney hashtag#BrandGrowth hashtag#KendygitalMedia hashtag#StorytellingForBrands hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopmenthashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#30DayChallengeDay 4 of hashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt.

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career? I’d love to hear your story.hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#SocialMediaManager hashtag#EntrepreneurJourney hashtag#BrandGrowth hashtag#KendygitalMedia hashtag#StorytellingForBrands hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopmenthashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#30DayChallengeDay 4 of hashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt.

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps?

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career? I’d love to hear your story.hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#SocialMediaManager hashtag#EntrepreneurJourney hashtag#BrandGrowth hashtag#KendygitalMedia hashtag#StorytellingForBrands hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopmenthashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#30DayChallengeDay 4 of hashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Why?Because tech roles offer better pay, faster growth, and global opportunities.💻📈🌍But here’s the hard truth:Most people only like the outcome, not the process.They dream of a high-paying job, remote work, and a laptop lifestyle —But they don't want to learn.They don’t compete.They don’t complete the journey.And when they don't land their first internship or job, they blame the job market or companies.❌ But the real problem?They only dreamed — they never prepared.The market isn't broken.Your mindset might be.If you really want to succeed as a developer, you have to:✅ Learn consistently✅ Build real projects✅ Compete with discipline✅ Never stop improvingEveryone wants to become a developer.But not everyone becomes one.Dreaming is the start —Doing is what makes it real.Work for your dreams.Or someone else will live them instead.⚒️💡hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#DeveloperJourney hashtag#PakistanTech hashtag#LearnToEarn hashtag#NoShortcuts hashtag#HardWorkPaysOff hashtag#InternshipHunt hashtag#FutureInTech hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#MindsetMatters

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt.

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps?

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career? I’d love to hear your story.hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#SocialMediaManager hashtag#EntrepreneurJourney hashtag#BrandGrowth hashtag#KendygitalMedia hashtag#StorytellingForBrands hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopmenthashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#30DayChallengeDay 4 of hashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps?

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career? I’d love to hear your story.hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#SocialMediaManager hashtag#EntrepreneurJourney hashtag#BrandGrowth hashtag#KendygitalMedia hashtag#StorytellingForBrands hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopmenthashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#30DayChallengeDay 4 of hashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Gone He told me, “Maybe I’m not good enough.”I said: “You don’t need a hundred ‘yeses.’ You just need one — and it could be the next one.”David hesitated but agreed to send just one more application.He updated his CV, refreshed his LinkedIn profile, and applied for a role he felt slightly underqualified for.👉 3 days later: he got a callback 👉 A week later: interview 👉 Two weeks later: job offer — great salary, career growth, and a healthy work culture💡 Moral of the story? The job market can feel brutal, but it's also dynamic. Every week brings new openings, new recruiters, new chances.So if you're reading this and feeling discouraged, please hear this: Your dream job may not even be posted yet.

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Why?Because tech roles offer better pay, faster growth, and global opportunities.💻📈🌍But here’s the hard truth:Most people only like the outcome, not the process.They dream of a high-paying job, remote work, and a laptop lifestyle —But they don't want to learn.They don’t compete.They don’t complete the journey.And when they don't land their first internship or job, they blame the job market or companies.❌ But the real problem?They only dreamed — they never prepared.The market isn't broken.Your mindset might be.If you really want to succeed as a developer, you have to:✅ Learn consistently✅ Build real projects✅ Compete with discipline✅ Never stop improvingEveryone wants to become a developer.But not everyone becomes one.Dreaming is the start —Doing is what makes it real.Work for your dreams.Or someone else will live them instead.⚒️💡hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#DeveloperJourney hashtag#PakistanTech hashtag#LearnToEarn hashtag#NoShortcuts hashtag#HardWorkPaysOff hashtag#InternshipHunt hashtag#FutureInTech hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#MindsetMatters

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Shubham BarwadShubham Barwad,,"🚀 Introducing EventX – A Universal Event Manager for .NET Apps 🧠⚙️In modern apps, components often need to react to things happening elsewhere — a product added to cart, a user logging in, a notification being dismissed. But wiring this up cleanly across unrelated components can be messy, especially in larger Blazor or MAUI apps.That’s where EventX comes in — a lightweight, thread-safe C# library that brings event-driven architecture to your .NET apps, with zero boilerplate.🔧 What it does:🔁 Publish/subscribe to events across the app (sync & async)🔒 Strongly-typed and memory-leak safe🚫 Auto-remove listeners with .Once()✅ Works in Blazor (Server/WASM), MAUI, WPF, etc.📦 Real-World Use Cases:🛒 Mini Cart updates in E-commerce apps🔔 Toast Notifications triggered globally📣 Multi-tab communication (via BroadcastChannel)🧠 Loose coupling between services and UI🕵️‍♂️ Debugging memory leaks with scoped unsubscriptionHere's the beauty: with EventX, your components don’t need to know who is listening — they just fire an event, and magic happens 💥Visit the link to know more:https://lnkd.in/dvjefT8Ghashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp hashtag#blazor hashtag#blazorwasm hashtag#dotnetcore hashtag#eventdrivenarchitecture hashtag#developerexperience hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#frontenddevelopment hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#aspnetcore hashtag#softwarearchitecture hashtag#opensource hashtag#dependencyinjection hashtag#eventdriven hashtag#devtools hashtag#programming hashtag#softwareengineering hashtag#reactivity hashtag#multitab hashtag#browserapi hashtag#broadcastchannel hashtag#scalability hashtag#modulararchitecture hashtag#cleanarchitecture

MD. Tazimul Islam RajMD. Tazimul Islam Raj,,"🔹 ASP.NET Core Middleware Pipeline – Part 4: Static Files MiddlewareOnce HTTPS is enforced, the next step in the pipeline is enabling your app to serve static content like images, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.🗂️ What does Static Files Middleware do? It allows your ASP.NET Core app to serve files directly from the wwwroot folder (or any configured directory) without needing any controller logic.📦 UseStaticFiles() This middleware scans for static files and returns them if found, bypassing the rest of the pipeline.app.UseStaticFiles();📝 For example, if you have:wwwroot/css/site.cssA browser can request it at:https://lnkd.in/dnn8CzJb⚠️ Security Tip: By default, only the wwwroot folder is accessible. Avoid serving sensitive files by accidentally exposing other directories.🧠 Best Practice: Place UseStaticFiles() early in the pipeline so static content is returned before more complex processing (like routing or authentication).🚀 Coming up next: Routing Middleware — the backbone of request processing.hashtag#ASPNETCore hashtag#Middleware hashtag#DotNet hashtag#StaticFiles hashtag#WebDev hashtag#CSharp hashtag#BackendDevelopment

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Shubham BarwadShubham Barwad,,"🚀 Introducing EventX – A Universal Event Manager for .NET Apps 🧠⚙️In modern apps, components often need to react to things happening elsewhere — a product added to cart, a user logging in, a notification being dismissed. But wiring this up cleanly across unrelated components can be messy, especially in larger Blazor or MAUI apps.That’s where EventX comes in — a lightweight, thread-safe C# library that brings event-driven architecture to your .NET apps, with zero boilerplate.🔧 What it does:🔁 Publish/subscribe to events across the app (sync & async)🔒 Strongly-typed and memory-leak safe🚫 Auto-remove listeners with .Once()✅ Works in Blazor (Server/WASM), MAUI, WPF, etc.📦 Real-World Use Cases:🛒 Mini Cart updates in E-commerce apps🔔 Toast Notifications triggered globally📣 Multi-tab communication (via BroadcastChannel)🧠 Loose coupling between services and UI🕵️‍♂️ Debugging memory leaks with scoped unsubscriptionHere's the beauty: with EventX, your components don’t need to know who is listening — they just fire an event, and magic happens 💥Visit the link to know more:https://lnkd.in/dvjefT8Ghashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp hashtag#blazor hashtag#blazorwasm hashtag#dotnetcore hashtag#eventdrivenarchitecture hashtag#developerexperience hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#frontenddevelopment hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#aspnetcore hashtag#softwarearchitecture hashtag#opensource hashtag#dependencyinjection hashtag#eventdriven hashtag#devtools hashtag#programming hashtag#softwareengineering hashtag#reactivity hashtag#multitab hashtag#browserapi hashtag#broadcastchannel hashtag#scalability hashtag#modulararchitecture hashtag#cleanarchitecture

MD. Tazimul Islam RajMD. Tazimul Islam Raj,,"🔹 ASP.NET Core Middleware Pipeline – Part 4: Static Files MiddlewareOnce HTTPS is enforced, the next step in the pipeline is enabling your app to serve static content like images, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.🗂️ What does Static Files Middleware do? It allows your ASP.NET Core app to serve files directly from the wwwroot folder (or any configured directory) without needing any controller logic.📦 UseStaticFiles() This middleware scans for static files and returns them if found, bypassing the rest of the pipeline.app.UseStaticFiles();📝 For example, if you have:wwwroot/css/site.cssA browser can request it at:https://lnkd.in/dnn8CzJb⚠️ Security Tip: By default, only the wwwroot folder is accessible. Avoid serving sensitive files by accidentally exposing other directories.🧠 Best Practice: Place UseStaticFiles() early in the pipeline so static content is returned before more complex processing (like routing or authentication).🚀 Coming up next: Routing Middleware — the backbone of request processing.hashtag#ASPNETCore hashtag#Middleware hashtag#DotNet hashtag#StaticFiles hashtag#WebDev hashtag#CSharp hashtag#BackendDevelopment

Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly.

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps?

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career? I’d love to hear your story.hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#SocialMediaManager hashtag#EntrepreneurJourney hashtag#BrandGrowth hashtag#KendygitalMedia hashtag#StorytellingForBrands hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopmenthashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#30DayChallengeDay 4 of hashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

Shubham BarwadShubham Barwad,,"🚀 Introducing EventX – A Universal Event Manager for .NET Apps 🧠⚙️In modern apps, components often need to react to things happening elsewhere — a product added to cart, a user logging in, a notification being dismissed. But wiring this up cleanly across unrelated components can be messy, especially in larger Blazor or MAUI apps.That’s where EventX comes in — a lightweight, thread-safe C# library that brings event-driven architecture to your .NET apps, with zero boilerplate.🔧 What it does:🔁 Publish/subscribe to events across the app (sync & async)🔒 Strongly-typed and memory-leak safe🚫 Auto-remove listeners with .Once()✅ Works in Blazor (Server/WASM), MAUI, WPF, etc.📦 Real-World Use Cases:🛒 Mini Cart updates in E-commerce apps🔔 Toast Notifications triggered globally📣 Multi-tab communication (via BroadcastChannel)🧠 Loose coupling between services and UI🕵️‍♂️ Debugging memory leaks with scoped unsubscriptionHere's the beauty: with EventX, your components don’t need to know who is listening — they just fire an event, and magic happens 💥Visit the link to know more:https://lnkd.in/dvjefT8Ghashtag#dotnet hashtag#csharp hashtag#blazor hashtag#blazorwasm hashtag#dotnetcore hashtag#eventdrivenarchitecture hashtag#developerexperience hashtag#webdevelopment hashtag#frontenddevelopment hashtag#backenddevelopment hashtag#aspnetcore hashtag#softwarearchitecture hashtag#opensource hashtag#dependencyinjection hashtag#eventdriven hashtag#devtools hashtag#programming hashtag#softwareengineering hashtag#reactivity hashtag#multitab hashtag#browserapi hashtag#broadcastchannel hashtag#scalability hashtag#modulararchitecture hashtag#cleanarchitecture

MD. Tazimul Islam RajMD. Tazimul Islam Raj,,"🔹 ASP.NET Core Middleware Pipeline – Part 4: Static Files MiddlewareOnce HTTPS is enforced, the next step in the pipeline is enabling your app to serve static content like images, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.🗂️ What does Static Files Middleware do? It allows your ASP.NET Core app to serve files directly from the wwwroot folder (or any configured directory) without needing any controller logic.📦 UseStaticFiles() This middleware scans for static files and returns them if found, bypassing the rest of the pipeline.app.UseStaticFiles();📝 For example, if you have:wwwroot/css/site.cssA browser can request it at:https://lnkd.in/dnn8CzJb⚠️ Security Tip: By default, only the wwwroot folder is accessible. Avoid serving sensitive files by accidentally exposing other directories.🧠 Best Practice: Place UseStaticFiles() early in the pipeline so static content is returned before more complex processing (like routing or authentication).🚀 Coming up next: Routing Middleware — the backbone of request processing.hashtag#ASPNETCore hashtag#Middleware hashtag#DotNet hashtag#StaticFiles hashtag#WebDev hashtag#CSharp hashtag#BackendDevelopment

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps?

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career? I’d love to hear your story.hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#SocialMediaManager hashtag#EntrepreneurJourney hashtag#BrandGrowth hashtag#KendygitalMedia hashtag#StorytellingForBrands hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopmenthashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#ProfessionalDevelopment hashtag#30DayChallengeDay 4 of hashtag#BlessingIyareLinkedInChallenge

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

MD. Tazimul Islam RajMD. Tazimul Islam Raj,,"🔹 ASP.NET Core Middleware Pipeline – Part 4: Static Files MiddlewareOnce HTTPS is enforced, the next step in the pipeline is enabling your app to serve static content like images, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets.🗂️ What does Static Files Middleware do? It allows your ASP.NET Core app to serve files directly from the wwwroot folder (or any configured directory) without needing any controller logic.📦 UseStaticFiles() This middleware scans for static files and returns them if found, bypassing the rest of the pipeline.app.UseStaticFiles();📝 For example, if you have:wwwroot/css/site.cssA browser can request it at:https://lnkd.in/dnn8CzJb⚠️ Security Tip: By default, only the wwwroot folder is accessible. Avoid serving sensitive files by accidentally exposing other directories.🧠 Best Practice: Place UseStaticFiles() early in the pipeline so static content is returned before more complex processing (like routing or authentication).🚀 Coming up next: Routing Middleware — the backbone of request processing.hashtag#ASPNETCore hashtag#Middleware hashtag#DotNet hashtag#StaticFiles hashtag#WebDev hashtag#CSharp hashtag#BackendDevelopment

Babak GolkarBabak Golkar,,"🚀 𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀In large-scale projects, performance and debugging clarity are crucial, especially when mapping between domain models and DTOs. While AutoMapper is popular for reducing boilerplate and speeding up development with its convention-based approach, it can sometimes make the mapping process less transparent as projects grow and debugging becomes more complex. This has led to critical decisions about when and how to use it effectively.This led me to explore static extension methods for mapping. Although it might mean writing a bit more code upfront, using well-crafted static mapping methods offers improved performance through inlining and compile-time checks. More importantly, when it comes to troubleshooting, static methods allow you to set breakpoints easily, making the mapping logic transparent and maintainable over time.📌 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗮 𝗖# 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴.▶️ In the attached code sample, the ToDestination extension method is clear and concise. It checks for null references, assigns properties explicitly, and ensures that mapping logic is visible during debugging , allowing for breakpoint placement and step-by-step analysis .🎯 The trade-off ultimately comes down to performance and maintainability,two critical factors in enterprise-level applications, where subtle bugs can lead to expensive outages.The decision isn’t about declaring one approach universally superior, but rather recognizing the strengths of each in different scenarios: 1️⃣ 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗿excels in rapid prototyping and projects with straightforward mapping logic.2️⃣ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱𝘀provide finer control, better performance, and enhanced debuggability for complex, high-stakes systems.🔵 Follow me: https://lnkd.in/dGnqWVfP♻️ Reposthashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#DotNetCore hashtag#AutoMapper hashtag#ExtensionMethods hashtag#Mapping hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#Debugginghashtag#CSharp hashtag#Development hashtag#Programming hashtag#Dto hashtag#Entity

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Why?Because tech roles offer better pay, faster growth, and global opportunities.💻📈🌍But here’s the hard truth:Most people only like the outcome, not the process.They dream of a high-paying job, remote work, and a laptop lifestyle —But they don't want to learn.They don’t compete.They don’t complete the journey.And when they don't land their first internship or job, they blame the job market or companies.❌ But the real problem?They only dreamed — they never prepared.The market isn't broken.Your mindset might be.If you really want to succeed as a developer, you have to:✅ Learn consistently✅ Build real projects✅ Compete with discipline✅ Never stop improvingEveryone wants to become a developer.But not everyone becomes one.Dreaming is the start —Doing is what makes it real.Work for your dreams.Or someone else will live them instead.⚒️💡hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#DeveloperJourney hashtag#PakistanTech hashtag#LearnToEarn hashtag#NoShortcuts hashtag#HardWorkPaysOff hashtag#InternshipHunt hashtag#FutureInTech hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#MindsetMatters

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

It allows your ASP.NET Core app to serve files directly from the wwwroot folder (or any configured directory) without needing any controller logic.📦 UseStaticFiles() This middleware scans for static files and returns them if found, bypassing the rest of the pipeline.app.UseStaticFiles();📝 For example, if you have:wwwroot/css/site.cssA browser can request it at:https://lnkd.in/dnn8CzJb⚠️ Security Tip: By default, only the wwwroot folder is accessible. Avoid serving sensitive files by accidentally exposing other directories.🧠 Best Practice: Place UseStaticFiles() early in the pipeline so static content is returned before more complex processing (like routing or authentication).🚀 Coming up next: Routing Middleware — the backbone of request processing.hashtag#ASPNETCore hashtag#Middleware hashtag#DotNet hashtag#StaticFiles hashtag#WebDev hashtag#CSharp hashtag#BackendDevelopment

Babak GolkarBabak Golkar,,"🚀 𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀In large-scale projects, performance and debugging clarity are crucial, especially when mapping between domain models and DTOs. While AutoMapper is popular for reducing boilerplate and speeding up development with its convention-based approach, it can sometimes make the mapping process less transparent as projects grow and debugging becomes more complex. This has led to critical decisions about when and how to use it effectively.This led me to explore static extension methods for mapping. Although it might mean writing a bit more code upfront, using well-crafted static mapping methods offers improved performance through inlining and compile-time checks. More importantly, when it comes to troubleshooting, static methods allow you to set breakpoints easily, making the mapping logic transparent and maintainable over time.📌 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗮 𝗖# 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴.▶️ In the attached code sample, the ToDestination extension method is clear and concise. It checks for null references, assigns properties explicitly, and ensures that mapping logic is visible during debugging , allowing for breakpoint placement and step-by-step analysis .🎯 The trade-off ultimately comes down to performance and maintainability,two critical factors in enterprise-level applications, where subtle bugs can lead to expensive outages.The decision isn’t about declaring one approach universally superior, but rather recognizing the strengths of each in different scenarios: 1️⃣ 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗿excels in rapid prototyping and projects with straightforward mapping logic.2️⃣ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱𝘀provide finer control, better performance, and enhanced debuggability for complex, high-stakes systems.🔵 Follow me: https://lnkd.in/dGnqWVfP♻️ Reposthashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#DotNetCore hashtag#AutoMapper hashtag#ExtensionMethods hashtag#Mapping hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#Debugginghashtag#CSharp hashtag#Development hashtag#Programming hashtag#Dto hashtag#Entity

Lekan OgundairoLekan Ogundairo,,"Happy Monday, Network!Let’s start this week with a reminder that your journey is still unfolding—no matter how many rejections, delays, or closed doors you’ve faced.Last week, I read over 100 messages from job seekers pouring their hearts out. Stories of resilience. Disappointment. Persistence.And you know what? Every single one of them reminded me that we’re not alone in this.Rejection doesn’t mean you’re not qualified.It doesn’t mean you’re not worthy.It doesn’t mean your efforts are in vain.Sometimes, it simply means: “Not this door… try the next one.”Keep showing up.Keep learning.Keep growing.Because the right opportunity isn’t just looking for talent—it’s looking for someone with the mindset to thrive despite the odds.This week, give yourself permission to keep going.Not perfectly. Not without doubt. But with belief in the bigger picture.Wishing everyone a week of progress and peace.You’ve got this.hashtag#MondayMotivation hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#JobSearchJourney hashtag#KeepGoing hashtag#TelecomProfessionals hashtag#LekanOgundairo

Why?Because tech roles offer better pay, faster growth, and global opportunities.💻📈🌍But here’s the hard truth:Most people only like the outcome, not the process.They dream of a high-paying job, remote work, and a laptop lifestyle —But they don't want to learn.They don’t compete.They don’t complete the journey.And when they don't land their first internship or job, they blame the job market or companies.❌ But the real problem?They only dreamed — they never prepared.The market isn't broken.Your mindset might be.If you really want to succeed as a developer, you have to:✅ Learn consistently✅ Build real projects✅ Compete with discipline✅ Never stop improvingEveryone wants to become a developer.But not everyone becomes one.Dreaming is the start —Doing is what makes it real.Work for your dreams.Or someone else will live them instead.⚒️💡hashtag#TechCareers hashtag#DeveloperJourney hashtag#PakistanTech hashtag#LearnToEarn hashtag#NoShortcuts hashtag#HardWorkPaysOff hashtag#InternshipHunt hashtag#FutureInTech hashtag#CodingLife hashtag#MindsetMatters

Nour BaltiNour Balti,,"✅ ""Feature Flags in .NET – Control Your Releases Smarter""🚀 Ever released a new feature… only to immediately roll it back due to unexpected issues? Or wished you could test a feature in production — but only for a few users?That’s exactly where Feature Flags shine! They let you turn parts of your code ON or OFF at runtime, without deploying new code. Yes, really.👨‍💻 In .NET, using ""Microsoft.FeatureManagement"" makes this super easy.Here’s a quick example:if (await featureManager.IsEnabledAsync(FeatureFlags.ClipArticleContent)){ article.Content = article.Content.Substring(0, 50);}✅ Flag ON? Clip content.❌ Flag OFF? Return full content.🔁 All runtime controlled — no redeploys!💡 Use cases:*Gradual rollouts (10% of users → 100%)*Kill switches for unstable features*A/B testing*Ops-controlled togglesBut here’s the catch 👉 Adding flags is easy. Cleaning them up later is crucial. Otherwise, your codebase becomes a flag graveyard. ☠️🎨 Image Idea to explain this example of code  visaully : User → API → FeatureManager  | [Flag ON] — Shorten content [Flag OFF] — Return full content⚙️ How It Works:1-Check the Feature Flag: The application checks if a specific feature flag is enabled using the FeatureManager.2-Flag Disabled (""No""): If the flag is off, the app executes the fallback logic (e.g., reverting to a previous version of functionality).3-Flag Enabled (""Yes""): If the flag is on, the app proceeds with the new feature or functionality.💬Have you used feature flags in your apps? What’s your strategy for keeping things clean?hashtag#dotnet hashtag#featureflags hashtag#softwaredevelopment hashtag#cleanarchitecture hashtag#csharp hashtag#microservices

Endurance Success DedevwoEndurance Success Dedevwo,,"Turns out ‘We’ll send it soon’ isn’t legally binding. Who knew?One career mistake I made was working for organizations that never issued offer letters. At the time, I was eager to build my portfolio and gain experience, so I overlooked the importance of formal agreements. Unfortunately, it led to unclear expectations, lack of job security, and even situations where ""multitasking"" plus one's original job became the norm.I thought, “As long as the work is good, everything else will fall into place.” Well, it didn’t.The experience taught me a vital lesson: Professionalism starts with structure. Today, I prioritize clarity and mutual respect in any working relationship. If a company can’t provide a basic offer letter, it’s a red flag—not an opportunity and that is on period.To others: Have you had a similar experience or learned a tough lesson early in your career?

Moses maweuMoses maweu,,"The Interview That Turned Into a Gym Session — and Then a Robbery Chronicles of a Dev Who Just Wanted a 120K Job in WestlandsIn 2019, I applied for a developer interview through LinkedIn. The job ad said:“Tech startup hiring now! Salary 120K+. Interview in Westlands. Come prepared.” So far, so good. But then I saw this: “Dress official... but carry gym wear and sport shoes.”Weird, but okay. Maybe they value wellness culture or have a quirky onboarding process. It’s 2019, right? By 8:30 AM, We Were All SeatedWe came dressed in suits, laptops ready, resumes sharpened. Then someone walked in and said:“At our company, we respect work-life balance. All new hires must experience our paid gym sessions.” So we were told to change into gym clothes and head to Room C49 on the 6th floor. We left our laptops, phones, shoes, and official clothes in the changing room, thinking we’d be back in 45 mins. But the “45-Minute Wellness Session”… Turned Into a 2-Hour TrapAerobics. Motivation speeches. Some random zumba. It felt more like orientation for a pyramid scheme than a job interview. When we came back downstairs…The changing room was locked.We asked security. They said:“C49? That room has had no tenant for 6 months.”Laptops — gone. Phones — gone. Our hopes — vanished like an NFT market cap.We ran to Parklands Police Station, only to be told:“Oh yeah, we know the place. You’re not the first group.” Final Scene Me. In boxers. No fare. No phone. No laptop. Trekking to town like a confused athlete who missed the Olympics. If an interview asks for gym clothes, it's not a job — it's a workout scam and always — always — carry backup fare. Nairobi is unpredictable.hashtag#JobSearchChronicles hashtag#NairobiHustle hashtag#DeveloperLife hashtag#LinkedInRealTalk hashtag#ScamAlert hashtag#WorkLifeBalanceGoneWrong hashtag#StayWoke hashtag#trending hashtag#Jobs hashtag#africa

It allows your ASP.NET Core app to serve files directly from the wwwroot folder (or any configured directory) without needing any controller logic.📦 UseStaticFiles() This middleware scans for static files and returns them if found, bypassing the rest of the pipeline.app.UseStaticFiles();📝 For example, if you have:wwwroot/css/site.cssA browser can request it at:https://lnkd.in/dnn8CzJb⚠️ Security Tip: By default, only the wwwroot folder is accessible. Avoid serving sensitive files by accidentally exposing other directories.🧠 Best Practice: Place UseStaticFiles() early in the pipeline so static content is returned before more complex processing (like routing or authentication).🚀 Coming up next: Routing Middleware — the backbone of request processing.hashtag#ASPNETCore hashtag#Middleware hashtag#DotNet hashtag#StaticFiles hashtag#WebDev hashtag#CSharp hashtag#BackendDevelopment

Babak GolkarBabak Golkar,,"🚀 𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗟𝗮𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀In large-scale projects, performance and debugging clarity are crucial, especially when mapping between domain models and DTOs. While AutoMapper is popular for reducing boilerplate and speeding up development with its convention-based approach, it can sometimes make the mapping process less transparent as projects grow and debugging becomes more complex. This has led to critical decisions about when and how to use it effectively.This led me to explore static extension methods for mapping. Although it might mean writing a bit more code upfront, using well-crafted static mapping methods offers improved performance through inlining and compile-time checks. More importantly, when it comes to troubleshooting, static methods allow you to set breakpoints easily, making the mapping logic transparent and maintainable over time.📌 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗮 𝗖# 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗳 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗺𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗴.▶️ In the attached code sample, the ToDestination extension method is clear and concise. It checks for null references, assigns properties explicitly, and ensures that mapping logic is visible during debugging , allowing for breakpoint placement and step-by-step analysis .🎯 The trade-off ultimately comes down to performance and maintainability,two critical factors in enterprise-level applications, where subtle bugs can lead to expensive outages.The decision isn’t about declaring one approach universally superior, but rather recognizing the strengths of each in different scenarios: 1️⃣ 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗿excels in rapid prototyping and projects with straightforward mapping logic.2️⃣ 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱𝘀provide finer control, better performance, and enhanced debuggability for complex, high-stakes systems.🔵 Follow me: https://lnkd.in/dGnqWVfP♻️ Reposthashtag#CSharp hashtag#DotNet hashtag#DotNetCore hashtag#AutoMapper hashtag#ExtensionMethods hashtag#Mapping hashtag#CleanCode hashtag#PerformanceOptimization hashtag#Debugginghashtag#CSharp hashtag#Development hashtag#Programming hashtag#Dto hashtag#Entity
