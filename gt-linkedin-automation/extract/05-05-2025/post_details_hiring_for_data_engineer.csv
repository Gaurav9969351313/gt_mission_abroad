Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback. When was the last time you re-evaluated your research or feedback process? Is it time to refine your methods?

The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback. When was the last time you re-evaluated your research or feedback process? Is it time to refine your methods?

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

AI Agents Just Took Your Job 😳🧨 Controversial but true: “Learning Pandas in 2025 is like learning MS Paint to become a designer.”Too harsh? Let’s talk 👇 📉 The world has moved on… ✅ Data wrangling is now a baseline, not a competitive skill. ✅ AI tools can already clean, transform, and even analyze data – on their own. ✅ Meanwhile, companies are hiring for AI Agent Engineers who can build systems that think, act, and automate end-to-end.🤖 AI Agents are the new workforce. ✅ They don’t just give insights — they take action. ✅ Automate decisions, workflows, email replies, report generation… ✅ They are replacing 5 tools and 3 people in one go.💼 If you're still mastering Pandas, you're preparing for a job that AI can already do.

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nishant GhugeNishant Ghuge,,"Hey incredible LinkedIn folks across the globe! 🌍I’m thrilled to share my journey of cracking the Sliding Window Maximum problem from LeetCode, a fascinating coding challenge. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or just curious about what coders do, I’ve tailored this for everyone. I’m reaching out to Software Engineers, Backend Developers, Full Stack Developers, and hiring managers at startups, MAANG giants, and MNCs worldwide. Let’s connect and inspire each other! 🚀✨🌟 What’s This About? 🍽️Imagine sliding a small tray over a buffet table, picking the tastiest dish from each set. It’s a fun way to think about this problem!🌍 Real-World Relevance 🛒For non-tech folks, it’s like finding the best deal in a moving set of options; for techies, it’s spotting the largest number in a sliding window of a list.📊 Why It Matters 🧪This is a classic problem in data processing, often seen in interviews, testing how you handle efficiency.🕒 Common Use 📈Think of stock price analysis or real-time data streams where you need quick insights from moving data chunks.🔧 My Quick Approach 🧠I avoided the slow “check every single thing” method and used a smart “VIP list” (hint: a priority structure) to track potential top picks, updating as I slide. Super fast for big data! ⚡🛠️ Step 1: Understand 📝First, I broke down the idea of a moving frame over numbers, ensuring I knew exactly what to find.⚡ Step 2: Optimize ⏩Instead of rechecking everything, my VIP list only keeps track of numbers that could be the biggest, saving time.📋 Step 3: Execute ✅As the window moves, I update this list by dropping outdated or smaller values, always having the top number ready.📈 What I Learned 💪I mastered efficiency for scalable systems and how to explain complex ideas simply. A huge win for teamwork and real-world projects! 🌟🌱 Skill Growth 🚀This taught me to prioritize speed in coding, crucial for apps handling tons of data without lagging.🗣️ Communication 💬Simplifying this problem honed my ability to share tech concepts with non-tech teammates or clients.💡 Problem-Solving 🕵️‍♂️It reinforced my knack for finding creative shortcuts, a skill I’m eager to apply in professional settings.🤝 Why Share This? 🌎I’m hashtag#OpentoWork for hybrid/remote roles, especially in India, at startups or MAANG companies. Hiring Managers, Recruiters, HR pros-let’s talk! Tech pals, let’s swap ideas! 📢📩 Open to Connect 📧I’m keen to discuss opportunities where I can contribute to innovative tech solutions.🌐 Global Reach 🗺️I’m looking for roles worldwide, bringing adaptability and a passion for learning to any team.🤲 Collaboration 👥I’d love to brainstorm with fellow developers on this or other challenges to grow together.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#Python hashtag#Coding hashtag#LeetCode hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Startups hashtag#MAANG hashtag#Technology hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Careers hashtag#JobOpening hashtag#Recruitment 🖥️📱📷 See the Visual ✨

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nishant GhugeNishant Ghuge,,"Hey incredible LinkedIn folks across the globe! 🌍I’m thrilled to share my journey of cracking the Sliding Window Maximum problem from LeetCode, a fascinating coding challenge. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or just curious about what coders do, I’ve tailored this for everyone. I’m reaching out to Software Engineers, Backend Developers, Full Stack Developers, and hiring managers at startups, MAANG giants, and MNCs worldwide. Let’s connect and inspire each other! 🚀✨🌟 What’s This About? 🍽️Imagine sliding a small tray over a buffet table, picking the tastiest dish from each set. It’s a fun way to think about this problem!🌍 Real-World Relevance 🛒For non-tech folks, it’s like finding the best deal in a moving set of options; for techies, it’s spotting the largest number in a sliding window of a list.📊 Why It Matters 🧪This is a classic problem in data processing, often seen in interviews, testing how you handle efficiency.🕒 Common Use 📈Think of stock price analysis or real-time data streams where you need quick insights from moving data chunks.🔧 My Quick Approach 🧠I avoided the slow “check every single thing” method and used a smart “VIP list” (hint: a priority structure) to track potential top picks, updating as I slide. Super fast for big data! ⚡🛠️ Step 1: Understand 📝First, I broke down the idea of a moving frame over numbers, ensuring I knew exactly what to find.⚡ Step 2: Optimize ⏩Instead of rechecking everything, my VIP list only keeps track of numbers that could be the biggest, saving time.📋 Step 3: Execute ✅As the window moves, I update this list by dropping outdated or smaller values, always having the top number ready.📈 What I Learned 💪I mastered efficiency for scalable systems and how to explain complex ideas simply. A huge win for teamwork and real-world projects! 🌟🌱 Skill Growth 🚀This taught me to prioritize speed in coding, crucial for apps handling tons of data without lagging.🗣️ Communication 💬Simplifying this problem honed my ability to share tech concepts with non-tech teammates or clients.💡 Problem-Solving 🕵️‍♂️It reinforced my knack for finding creative shortcuts, a skill I’m eager to apply in professional settings.🤝 Why Share This? 🌎I’m hashtag#OpentoWork for hybrid/remote roles, especially in India, at startups or MAANG companies. Hiring Managers, Recruiters, HR pros-let’s talk! Tech pals, let’s swap ideas! 📢📩 Open to Connect 📧I’m keen to discuss opportunities where I can contribute to innovative tech solutions.🌐 Global Reach 🗺️I’m looking for roles worldwide, bringing adaptability and a passion for learning to any team.🤲 Collaboration 👥I’d love to brainstorm with fellow developers on this or other challenges to grow together.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#Python hashtag#Coding hashtag#LeetCode hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Startups hashtag#MAANG hashtag#Technology hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Careers hashtag#JobOpening hashtag#Recruitment 🖥️📱📷 See the Visual ✨

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

AI Agents Just Took Your Job 😳🧨 Controversial but true: “Learning Pandas in 2025 is like learning MS Paint to become a designer.”Too harsh? Let’s talk 👇 📉 The world has moved on… ✅ Data wrangling is now a baseline, not a competitive skill. ✅ AI tools can already clean, transform, and even analyze data – on their own. ✅ Meanwhile, companies are hiring for AI Agent Engineers who can build systems that think, act, and automate end-to-end.🤖 AI Agents are the new workforce. ✅ They don’t just give insights — they take action. ✅ Automate decisions, workflows, email replies, report generation… ✅ They are replacing 5 tools and 3 people in one go.💼 If you're still mastering Pandas, you're preparing for a job that AI can already do. You need to level up — not just with tools, but with systems thinking.🔥 Want to learn how to build the AI Agents replacing traditional roles? 👇 Start here, before your skills expire: https://lnkd.in/gjywAjX6hashtag#GrowDataSkills Shashank Mishra 🇮🇳 SHAILJA MISHRA🟢 Rahul Shukla Sahil Choudhary Aman Kumarhashtag#AIAgents hashtag#ControversialTake hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#UpskillNow

Nishant GhugeNishant Ghuge,,"Hey incredible LinkedIn folks across the globe! 🌍I’m thrilled to share my journey of cracking the Sliding Window Maximum problem from LeetCode, a fascinating coding challenge. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or just curious about what coders do, I’ve tailored this for everyone. I’m reaching out to Software Engineers, Backend Developers, Full Stack Developers, and hiring managers at startups, MAANG giants, and MNCs worldwide. Let’s connect and inspire each other! 🚀✨🌟 What’s This About? 🍽️Imagine sliding a small tray over a buffet table, picking the tastiest dish from each set. It’s a fun way to think about this problem!🌍 Real-World Relevance 🛒For non-tech folks, it’s like finding the best deal in a moving set of options; for techies, it’s spotting the largest number in a sliding window of a list.📊 Why It Matters 🧪This is a classic problem in data processing, often seen in interviews, testing how you handle efficiency.🕒 Common Use 📈Think of stock price analysis or real-time data streams where you need quick insights from moving data chunks.🔧 My Quick Approach 🧠I avoided the slow “check every single thing” method and used a smart “VIP list” (hint: a priority structure) to track potential top picks, updating as I slide. Super fast for big data! ⚡🛠️ Step 1: Understand 📝First, I broke down the idea of a moving frame over numbers, ensuring I knew exactly what to find.⚡ Step 2: Optimize ⏩Instead of rechecking everything, my VIP list only keeps track of numbers that could be the biggest, saving time.📋 Step 3: Execute ✅As the window moves, I update this list by dropping outdated or smaller values, always having the top number ready.📈 What I Learned 💪I mastered efficiency for scalable systems and how to explain complex ideas simply. A huge win for teamwork and real-world projects! 🌟🌱 Skill Growth 🚀This taught me to prioritize speed in coding, crucial for apps handling tons of data without lagging.🗣️ Communication 💬Simplifying this problem honed my ability to share tech concepts with non-tech teammates or clients.💡 Problem-Solving 🕵️‍♂️It reinforced my knack for finding creative shortcuts, a skill I’m eager to apply in professional settings.🤝 Why Share This? 🌎I’m hashtag#OpentoWork for hybrid/remote roles, especially in India, at startups or MAANG companies. Hiring Managers, Recruiters, HR pros-let’s talk! Tech pals, let’s swap ideas! 📢📩 Open to Connect 📧I’m keen to discuss opportunities where I can contribute to innovative tech solutions.🌐 Global Reach 🗺️I’m looking for roles worldwide, bringing adaptability and a passion for learning to any team.🤲 Collaboration 👥I’d love to brainstorm with fellow developers on this or other challenges to grow together.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#Python hashtag#Coding hashtag#LeetCode hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Startups hashtag#MAANG hashtag#Technology hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Careers hashtag#JobOpening hashtag#Recruitment 🖥️📱📷 See the Visual ✨

Nishant GhugeNishant Ghuge,,"Hey incredible LinkedIn folks across the globe! 🌍I’m thrilled to share my journey of cracking the Sliding Window Maximum problem from LeetCode, a fascinating coding challenge. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or just curious about what coders do, I’ve tailored this for everyone. I’m reaching out to Software Engineers, Backend Developers, Full Stack Developers, and hiring managers at startups, MAANG giants, and MNCs worldwide. Let’s connect and inspire each other! 🚀✨🌟 What’s This About? 🍽️Imagine sliding a small tray over a buffet table, picking the tastiest dish from each set. It’s a fun way to think about this problem!🌍 Real-World Relevance 🛒For non-tech folks, it’s like finding the best deal in a moving set of options; for techies, it’s spotting the largest number in a sliding window of a list.📊 Why It Matters 🧪This is a classic problem in data processing, often seen in interviews, testing how you handle efficiency.🕒 Common Use 📈Think of stock price analysis or real-time data streams where you need quick insights from moving data chunks.🔧 My Quick Approach 🧠I avoided the slow “check every single thing” method and used a smart “VIP list” (hint: a priority structure) to track potential top picks, updating as I slide. Super fast for big data! ⚡🛠️ Step 1: Understand 📝First, I broke down the idea of a moving frame over numbers, ensuring I knew exactly what to find.⚡ Step 2: Optimize ⏩Instead of rechecking everything, my VIP list only keeps track of numbers that could be the biggest, saving time.📋 Step 3: Execute ✅As the window moves, I update this list by dropping outdated or smaller values, always having the top number ready.📈 What I Learned 💪I mastered efficiency for scalable systems and how to explain complex ideas simply. A huge win for teamwork and real-world projects! 🌟🌱 Skill Growth 🚀This taught me to prioritize speed in coding, crucial for apps handling tons of data without lagging.🗣️ Communication 💬Simplifying this problem honed my ability to share tech concepts with non-tech teammates or clients.💡 Problem-Solving 🕵️‍♂️It reinforced my knack for finding creative shortcuts, a skill I’m eager to apply in professional settings.🤝 Why Share This? 🌎I’m hashtag#OpentoWork for hybrid/remote roles, especially in India, at startups or MAANG companies. Hiring Managers, Recruiters, HR pros-let’s talk! Tech pals, let’s swap ideas! 📢📩 Open to Connect 📧I’m keen to discuss opportunities where I can contribute to innovative tech solutions.🌐 Global Reach 🗺️I’m looking for roles worldwide, bringing adaptability and a passion for learning to any team.🤲 Collaboration 👥I’d love to brainstorm with fellow developers on this or other challenges to grow together.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#Python hashtag#Coding hashtag#LeetCode hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Startups hashtag#MAANG hashtag#Technology hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Careers hashtag#JobOpening hashtag#Recruitment 🖥️📱📷 See the Visual ✨

Simon NinanSimon Ninan,,"It was a privilege to be a keynote speaker at an event last week organized by the Consulate General of India, San Francisco, featuring a powerhouse delegation of tech CEOs from India under the banner of nasscom. Looking around the room, it was a personal moment of pride to see a small sampling of the tremendous accomplishments and global impacts of the Indian tech industry over just 3 decades, and the immense potential for the future.The event also featured Prof. Arogyaswami Paulraj from Stanford University and Manthan Shah from WestBridge Capital, who talked about India's tech innovation journey and the bourgeoning investment environment.I spoke about the Digital Divide, both its growing challenges as well as the sizeable opportunity that it represents for India. Some stats that stand out:◽ Across Europe and the US, job requirements for digital skills are up by 50%◽ Per a recent survey, 1 in 3 workers lack foundational digital skills◽ 78% of companies admitted to lowering hiring standards due to lack of skills◽ While India and the US rank 2nd and 3rd in terms of Internet users, the ‘unconnected’ Indian population is 685M, twice the entire US population◽ $11.5T in GDP growth could be be missed across 14 G20 countries if the digital skills gap is not bridgedAnd, developments in AI could exacerbate – or address – that gap:◽ In share of knowledge workers using GenAI at work, India leads the world at 92%; the US is 5th with 71%◽ In contrast, the IMF’s AI Preparedness Index, based on a range of macro-structural factors, ranks the US 3rd with a score of 0.77 and India much lower at 0.49 ◽ AI Research Publication is a fascinating data point – China has shot to 1st place, outstripping the EU, US, and India (4th)The data points are stark. But so are the opportunities and choices ahead for Indian tech, including its impact on global tech trade. One of the keys, as I laid out, is the kind of ecosystems we build – especially as we work across blurring boundaries. The right ecosystems, formal and informal, create a ""web of value"" that enable new collaborations, accelerate innovations and learning, enable new business models, and foster new cultures. I shared with the group about how Hitachi effectively deploys such ecosystems to solve ‘wicked’, generational problems.There are differences between Silicon Valley and Indian tech, but they can become openings to bring the best of both worlds to bear.I am enthusiastic about what the future holds, especially as the bonds grow stronger between Silicon Valley and India. Many thanks to the Consul General Dr. Srikar Reddy Koppula, NASSCOM delegation leader Shivendra Singh, and co-organizers GITPRO (led by Khanderao Kand) and ITServe Alliance (led by Shabana Siraj), TiE Silicon Valley and ASEI (American Society of Engineers of Indian Origin).Hitachi Vantara GlobalLogic Hitachi America Ltd.hashtag#Ecosystems hashtag#IndiaUSCollaboration hashtag#TechForGood

The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback.

Nishant GhugeNishant Ghuge,,"Hey incredible LinkedIn folks across the globe! 🌍I’m thrilled to share my journey of cracking the Sliding Window Maximum problem from LeetCode, a fascinating coding challenge. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or just curious about what coders do, I’ve tailored this for everyone. I’m reaching out to Software Engineers, Backend Developers, Full Stack Developers, and hiring managers at startups, MAANG giants, and MNCs worldwide. Let’s connect and inspire each other! 🚀✨🌟 What’s This About? 🍽️Imagine sliding a small tray over a buffet table, picking the tastiest dish from each set. It’s a fun way to think about this problem!🌍 Real-World Relevance 🛒For non-tech folks, it’s like finding the best deal in a moving set of options; for techies, it’s spotting the largest number in a sliding window of a list.📊 Why It Matters 🧪This is a classic problem in data processing, often seen in interviews, testing how you handle efficiency.🕒 Common Use 📈Think of stock price analysis or real-time data streams where you need quick insights from moving data chunks.🔧 My Quick Approach 🧠I avoided the slow “check every single thing” method and used a smart “VIP list” (hint: a priority structure) to track potential top picks, updating as I slide. Super fast for big data! ⚡🛠️ Step 1: Understand 📝First, I broke down the idea of a moving frame over numbers, ensuring I knew exactly what to find.⚡ Step 2: Optimize ⏩Instead of rechecking everything, my VIP list only keeps track of numbers that could be the biggest, saving time.📋 Step 3: Execute ✅As the window moves, I update this list by dropping outdated or smaller values, always having the top number ready.📈 What I Learned 💪I mastered efficiency for scalable systems and how to explain complex ideas simply. A huge win for teamwork and real-world projects! 🌟🌱 Skill Growth 🚀This taught me to prioritize speed in coding, crucial for apps handling tons of data without lagging.🗣️ Communication 💬Simplifying this problem honed my ability to share tech concepts with non-tech teammates or clients.💡 Problem-Solving 🕵️‍♂️It reinforced my knack for finding creative shortcuts, a skill I’m eager to apply in professional settings.🤝 Why Share This? 🌎I’m hashtag#OpentoWork for hybrid/remote roles, especially in India, at startups or MAANG companies. Hiring Managers, Recruiters, HR pros-let’s talk! Tech pals, let’s swap ideas! 📢📩 Open to Connect 📧I’m keen to discuss opportunities where I can contribute to innovative tech solutions.🌐 Global Reach 🗺️I’m looking for roles worldwide, bringing adaptability and a passion for learning to any team.🤲 Collaboration 👥I’d love to brainstorm with fellow developers on this or other challenges to grow together.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#Python hashtag#Coding hashtag#LeetCode hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Startups hashtag#MAANG hashtag#Technology hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Careers hashtag#JobOpening hashtag#Recruitment 🖥️📱📷 See the Visual ✨

Simon NinanSimon Ninan,,"It was a privilege to be a keynote speaker at an event last week organized by the Consulate General of India, San Francisco, featuring a powerhouse delegation of tech CEOs from India under the banner of nasscom. Looking around the room, it was a personal moment of pride to see a small sampling of the tremendous accomplishments and global impacts of the Indian tech industry over just 3 decades, and the immense potential for the future.The event also featured Prof. Arogyaswami Paulraj from Stanford University and Manthan Shah from WestBridge Capital, who talked about India's tech innovation journey and the bourgeoning investment environment.I spoke about the Digital Divide, both its growing challenges as well as the sizeable opportunity that it represents for India. Some stats that stand out:◽ Across Europe and the US, job requirements for digital skills are up by 50%◽ Per a recent survey, 1 in 3 workers lack foundational digital skills◽ 78% of companies admitted to lowering hiring standards due to lack of skills◽ While India and the US rank 2nd and 3rd in terms of Internet users, the ‘unconnected’ Indian population is 685M, twice the entire US population◽ $11.5T in GDP growth could be be missed across 14 G20 countries if the digital skills gap is not bridgedAnd, developments in AI could exacerbate – or address – that gap:◽ In share of knowledge workers using GenAI at work, India leads the world at 92%; the US is 5th with 71%◽ In contrast, the IMF’s AI Preparedness Index, based on a range of macro-structural factors, ranks the US 3rd with a score of 0.77 and India much lower at 0.49 ◽ AI Research Publication is a fascinating data point – China has shot to 1st place, outstripping the EU, US, and India (4th)The data points are stark. But so are the opportunities and choices ahead for Indian tech, including its impact on global tech trade. One of the keys, as I laid out, is the kind of ecosystems we build – especially as we work across blurring boundaries. The right ecosystems, formal and informal, create a ""web of value"" that enable new collaborations, accelerate innovations and learning, enable new business models, and foster new cultures. I shared with the group about how Hitachi effectively deploys such ecosystems to solve ‘wicked’, generational problems.There are differences between Silicon Valley and Indian tech, but they can become openings to bring the best of both worlds to bear.I am enthusiastic about what the future holds, especially as the bonds grow stronger between Silicon Valley and India. Many thanks to the Consul General Dr. Srikar Reddy Koppula, NASSCOM delegation leader Shivendra Singh, and co-organizers GITPRO (led by Khanderao Kand) and ITServe Alliance (led by Shabana Siraj), TiE Silicon Valley and ASEI (American Society of Engineers of Indian Origin).Hitachi Vantara GlobalLogic Hitachi America Ltd.hashtag#Ecosystems hashtag#IndiaUSCollaboration hashtag#TechForGood

Nimra MukhtarNimra Mukhtar,,"What is your target audience really thinking, but not telling you? 🕵️‍♂️ Even the best-designed surveys or feedback loops can miss key insights if they're too focused on surface-level questions. The truth is, respondents often won’t say the full story outright. Here’s where the gaps can appear:Asking the what but skipping the why. Overlooking emotional drivers behind decisions. Assuming feedback silence means satisfaction. These unnoticed blind spots could mean missing out on valuable opportunities nested in unspoken feedback. When was the last time you re-evaluated your research or feedback process? Is it time to refine your methods?

Let’s talk 👇 📉 The world has moved on… ✅ Data wrangling is now a baseline, not a competitive skill. ✅ AI tools can already clean, transform, and even analyze data – on their own. ✅ Meanwhile, companies are hiring for AI Agent Engineers who can build systems that think, act, and automate end-to-end.🤖 AI Agents are the new workforce. ✅ They don’t just give insights — they take action. ✅ Automate decisions, workflows, email replies, report generation… ✅ They are replacing 5 tools and 3 people in one go.💼 If you're still mastering Pandas, you're preparing for a job that AI can already do. You need to level up — not just with tools, but with systems thinking.🔥 Want to learn how to build the AI Agents replacing traditional roles? 👇 Start here, before your skills expire: https://lnkd.in/gjywAjX6hashtag#GrowDataSkills Shashank Mishra 🇮🇳 SHAILJA MISHRA🟢 Rahul Shukla Sahil Choudhary Aman Kumarhashtag#AIAgents hashtag#ControversialTake hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#DataScience hashtag#CareerGrowth hashtag#UpskillNow

Nishant GhugeNishant Ghuge,,"Hey incredible LinkedIn folks across the globe! 🌍I’m thrilled to share my journey of cracking the Sliding Window Maximum problem from LeetCode, a fascinating coding challenge. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or just curious about what coders do, I’ve tailored this for everyone. I’m reaching out to Software Engineers, Backend Developers, Full Stack Developers, and hiring managers at startups, MAANG giants, and MNCs worldwide. Let’s connect and inspire each other! 🚀✨🌟 What’s This About? 🍽️Imagine sliding a small tray over a buffet table, picking the tastiest dish from each set. It’s a fun way to think about this problem!🌍 Real-World Relevance 🛒For non-tech folks, it’s like finding the best deal in a moving set of options; for techies, it’s spotting the largest number in a sliding window of a list.📊 Why It Matters 🧪This is a classic problem in data processing, often seen in interviews, testing how you handle efficiency.🕒 Common Use 📈Think of stock price analysis or real-time data streams where you need quick insights from moving data chunks.🔧 My Quick Approach 🧠I avoided the slow “check every single thing” method and used a smart “VIP list” (hint: a priority structure) to track potential top picks, updating as I slide. Super fast for big data! ⚡🛠️ Step 1: Understand 📝First, I broke down the idea of a moving frame over numbers, ensuring I knew exactly what to find.⚡ Step 2: Optimize ⏩Instead of rechecking everything, my VIP list only keeps track of numbers that could be the biggest, saving time.📋 Step 3: Execute ✅As the window moves, I update this list by dropping outdated or smaller values, always having the top number ready.📈 What I Learned 💪I mastered efficiency for scalable systems and how to explain complex ideas simply. A huge win for teamwork and real-world projects! 🌟🌱 Skill Growth 🚀This taught me to prioritize speed in coding, crucial for apps handling tons of data without lagging.🗣️ Communication 💬Simplifying this problem honed my ability to share tech concepts with non-tech teammates or clients.💡 Problem-Solving 🕵️‍♂️It reinforced my knack for finding creative shortcuts, a skill I’m eager to apply in professional settings.🤝 Why Share This? 🌎I’m hashtag#OpentoWork for hybrid/remote roles, especially in India, at startups or MAANG companies. Hiring Managers, Recruiters, HR pros-let’s talk! Tech pals, let’s swap ideas! 📢📩 Open to Connect 📧I’m keen to discuss opportunities where I can contribute to innovative tech solutions.🌐 Global Reach 🗺️I’m looking for roles worldwide, bringing adaptability and a passion for learning to any team.🤲 Collaboration 👥I’d love to brainstorm with fellow developers on this or other challenges to grow together.hashtag#SoftwareEngineer hashtag#BackendDeveloper hashtag#FullStackDeveloper hashtag#Python hashtag#Coding hashtag#LeetCode hashtag#TechJobs hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Startups hashtag#MAANG hashtag#Technology hashtag#Innovation hashtag#Careers hashtag#JobOpening hashtag#Recruitment 🖥️📱📷 See the Visual ✨

Simon NinanSimon Ninan,,"It was a privilege to be a keynote speaker at an event last week organized by the Consulate General of India, San Francisco, featuring a powerhouse delegation of tech CEOs from India under the banner of nasscom. Looking around the room, it was a personal moment of pride to see a small sampling of the tremendous accomplishments and global impacts of the Indian tech industry over just 3 decades, and the immense potential for the future.The event also featured Prof. Arogyaswami Paulraj from Stanford University and Manthan Shah from WestBridge Capital, who talked about India's tech innovation journey and the bourgeoning investment environment.I spoke about the Digital Divide, both its growing challenges as well as the sizeable opportunity that it represents for India. Some stats that stand out:◽ Across Europe and the US, job requirements for digital skills are up by 50%◽ Per a recent survey, 1 in 3 workers lack foundational digital skills◽ 78% of companies admitted to lowering hiring standards due to lack of skills◽ While India and the US rank 2nd and 3rd in terms of Internet users, the ‘unconnected’ Indian population is 685M, twice the entire US population◽ $11.5T in GDP growth could be be missed across 14 G20 countries if the digital skills gap is not bridgedAnd, developments in AI could exacerbate – or address – that gap:◽ In share of knowledge workers using GenAI at work, India leads the world at 92%; the US is 5th with 71%◽ In contrast, the IMF’s AI Preparedness Index, based on a range of macro-structural factors, ranks the US 3rd with a score of 0.77 and India much lower at 0.49 ◽ AI Research Publication is a fascinating data point – China has shot to 1st place, outstripping the EU, US, and India (4th)The data points are stark. But so are the opportunities and choices ahead for Indian tech, including its impact on global tech trade. One of the keys, as I laid out, is the kind of ecosystems we build – especially as we work across blurring boundaries. The right ecosystems, formal and informal, create a ""web of value"" that enable new collaborations, accelerate innovations and learning, enable new business models, and foster new cultures. I shared with the group about how Hitachi effectively deploys such ecosystems to solve ‘wicked’, generational problems.There are differences between Silicon Valley and Indian tech, but they can become openings to bring the best of both worlds to bear.I am enthusiastic about what the future holds, especially as the bonds grow stronger between Silicon Valley and India. Many thanks to the Consul General Dr. Srikar Reddy Koppula, NASSCOM delegation leader Shivendra Singh, and co-organizers GITPRO (led by Khanderao Kand) and ITServe Alliance (led by Shabana Siraj), TiE Silicon Valley and ASEI (American Society of Engineers of Indian Origin).Hitachi Vantara GlobalLogic Hitachi America Ltd.hashtag#Ecosystems hashtag#IndiaUSCollaboration hashtag#TechForGood
