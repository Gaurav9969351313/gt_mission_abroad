Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 exploring concepts like 𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 📈, 𝒇𝒂𝒖𝒍𝒕 𝒕𝒐𝒍𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 🛡️, and 𝒅𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒃𝒖𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒔𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒔 🌐 and it’s completely reshaping how I approach infrastructure and operations.At its core, DevOps is about optimizing the software delivery lifecycle. But here’s the thing: the effectiveness of DevOps practices is deeply tied to the quality of the system design. A well-architected system 🏗️ makes it easier to build scalable pipelines, automate deployments, and ensure reliability. On the flip side, poor design decisions like 𝒂 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒇𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒖𝒓𝒆 ❌ or 𝒂𝒏 𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆 🐌 can create bottlenecks that no amount of automation can solve.This journey has taught me a valuable lesson: 𝑫𝙚𝒗𝙊𝒑𝙨 𝙖𝒏𝙙 𝙨𝒚𝙨𝒕𝙚𝒎 𝒅𝙚𝒔𝙞𝒈𝙣 𝙖𝒓𝙚 𝙩𝒘𝙤 𝙨𝒊𝙙𝒆𝙨 𝙤𝒇 𝒕𝙝𝒆 𝒔𝙖𝒎𝙚 𝙘𝒐𝙞𝒏. While DevOps focuses on efficiency and speed ⚡, system design ensures we’re building systems that can handle scale, resilience, and performance from the ground up.I’m curious how has learning about system design or DevOps influenced the way you approach engineering challenges?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Ifeoluwa AdaralegbeIfeoluwa Adaralegbe,,"🚀𝐃𝐞𝐯𝐎𝐩𝐬, 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧 & 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐢𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞One of the things I ❤️ most about 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗢𝗽𝘀 is how it pushes us to think beyond just automation and CI/CD pipelines. Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 exploring concepts like 𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 📈, 𝒇𝒂𝒖𝒍𝒕 𝒕𝒐𝒍𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 🛡️, and 𝒅𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒃𝒖𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒔𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒔 🌐 and it’s completely reshaping how I approach infrastructure and operations.At its core, DevOps is about optimizing the software delivery lifecycle. But here’s the thing: the effectiveness of DevOps practices is deeply tied to the quality of the system design. A well-architected system 🏗️ makes it easier to build scalable pipelines, automate deployments, and ensure reliability. On the flip side, poor design decisions like 𝒂 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒇𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒖𝒓𝒆 ❌ or 𝒂𝒏 𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆 🐌 can create bottlenecks that no amount of automation can solve.This journey has taught me a valuable lesson: 𝑫𝙚𝒗𝙊𝒑𝙨 𝙖𝒏𝙙 𝙨𝒚𝙨𝒕𝙚𝒎 𝒅𝙚𝒔𝙞𝒈𝙣 𝙖𝒓𝙚 𝙩𝒘𝙤 𝙨𝒊𝙙𝒆𝙨 𝙤𝒇 𝒕𝙝𝒆 𝒔𝙖𝒎𝙚 𝙘𝒐𝙞𝒏. While DevOps focuses on efficiency and speed ⚡, system design ensures we’re building systems that can handle scale, resilience, and performance from the ground up.I’m curious how has learning about system design or DevOps influenced the way you approach engineering challenges?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

But here’s the thing: the effectiveness of DevOps practices is deeply tied to the quality of the system design.

Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 exploring concepts like 𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 📈, 𝒇𝒂𝒖𝒍𝒕 𝒕𝒐𝒍𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 🛡️, and 𝒅𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒃𝒖𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒔𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒔 🌐 and it’s completely reshaping how I approach infrastructure and operations.At its core, DevOps is about optimizing the software delivery lifecycle. But here’s the thing: the effectiveness of DevOps practices is deeply tied to the quality of the system design. A well-architected system 🏗️ makes it easier to build scalable pipelines, automate deployments, and ensure reliability. On the flip side, poor design decisions like 𝒂 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒇𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒖𝒓𝒆 ❌ or 𝒂𝒏 𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆 🐌 can create bottlenecks that no amount of automation can solve.This journey has taught me a valuable lesson: 𝑫𝙚𝒗𝙊𝒑𝙨 𝙖𝒏𝙙 𝙨𝒚𝙨𝒕𝙚𝒎 𝒅𝙚𝒔𝙞𝒈𝙣 𝙖𝒓𝙚 𝙩𝒘𝙤 𝙨𝒊𝙙𝒆𝙨 𝙤𝒇 𝒕𝙝𝒆 𝒔𝙖𝒎𝙚 𝙘𝒐𝙞𝒏. While DevOps focuses on efficiency and speed ⚡, system design ensures we’re building systems that can handle scale, resilience, and performance from the ground up.I’m curious how has learning about system design or DevOps influenced the way you approach engineering challenges?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

But here’s the thing: the effectiveness of DevOps practices is deeply tied to the quality of the system design. A well-architected system 🏗️ makes it easier to build scalable pipelines, automate deployments, and ensure reliability. On the flip side, poor design decisions like 𝒂 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒇𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒖𝒓𝒆 ❌ or 𝒂𝒏 𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆 🐌 can create bottlenecks that no amount of automation can solve.This journey has taught me a valuable lesson: 𝑫𝙚𝒗𝙊𝒑𝙨 𝙖𝒏𝙙 𝙨𝒚𝙨𝒕𝙚𝒎 𝒅𝙚𝒔𝙞𝒈𝙣 𝙖𝒓𝙚 𝙩𝒘𝙤 𝙨𝒊𝙙𝒆𝙨 𝙤𝒇 𝒕𝙝𝒆 𝒔𝙖𝒎𝙚 𝙘𝒐𝙞𝒏. While DevOps focuses on efficiency and speed ⚡, system design ensures we’re building systems that can handle scale, resilience, and performance from the ground up.I’m curious how has learning about system design or DevOps influenced the way you approach engineering challenges?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

But here’s the thing: the effectiveness of DevOps practices is deeply tied to the quality of the system design.

Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Akhilesh MishraAkhilesh Mishra,,"Dear recruiters, stop looking for candidates with 100% JD match.If someone matches your entire DevOps job description, you're chasing unicorns.Think about it.When you require 10+ years of Kubernetes (a technology from 2014), mastery of 3 different CI/CD tools, 4 logging/monitoring tools, 3 scripting language and expert-level knowledge across AWS, Azure, AND GCP... you're not describing a real candidate.You're describing a fantasy.And what happens when you actually find this rare specimen?They'll probably get bored and leave.The best DevOps engineers I've ever worked with weren't the ones who checked every technical box on day one. They were the ones who:- Demonstrated exceptional problem-solving skills- Had a genuine passion for automating everything- Possessed a ""never stop learning"" mindset- Understood that reliability matters more than fancy techMost skills in the DevOps world can be learned within weeks by someone with the right foundation.Hire engineers who meet 70-80% of your technical requirements but bring the right mindset.Focus on finding candidates who understand systems thinking, who approach infrastructure as code, who automate relentlessly, and who prioritize reliability. The specific tools are just implementation details.Stop chasing the perfect resume match. Start looking for the perfect mindset match instead.Your infrastructure (and your hiring timeline) will thank you.

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Vinicius BarbosaVinicius Barbosa,,"You don’t need to know everything about AWS, but you should know this.Many people get stuck when starting with AWS because they think they need to master all 200+ services before deploying something to production.The truth? Most web applications use fewer than 10 services.If I had to relearn AWS in a more productive way—beyond just reading the docs and taking AWS courses—I would focus on these:✅ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Scalable virtual machines that provide computing power to run applications, offering flexibility in instance types, storage, and networking.✅ ECS (Elastic Container Service) with Fargate – A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run Docker containers without provisioning or managing servers, simplifying deployment and scaling.✅ S3 (Simple Storage Service) – Highly durable and scalable object storage designed for storing and retrieving files, backups, and static content, with built-in security and lifecycle policies.✅ RDS (Relational Database Service) / DynamoDB – RDS provides managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.), while DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database optimized for high-performance and scalable applications.✅ Lambda – A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests or file uploads) without the need to manage infrastructure, charging only for execution time.✅ API Gateway – A fully managed service that enables developers to create, deploy, and secure APIs at scale, integrating seamlessly with Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.✅ CloudWatch – A monitoring and observability service that collects logs, metrics, and events from AWS resources, enabling real-time insights, alerting, and troubleshooting.✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management) – AWS’s security framework for managing users, roles, and permissions to control access to AWS resources. Misconfigurations here can lead to serious security risks.✅ SNS (Simple Notification Service) / SQS (Simple Queue Service) – SNS is a pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications, while SQS provides message queuing for decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.Master these, and you’ll solve 90% of AWS-related problems without needing to memorize everything.AWS is huge, but you don’t need to know it all to be effective.

Recently, I’ve been diving deeper into 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 exploring concepts like 𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒃𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒕𝒚 📈, 𝒇𝒂𝒖𝒍𝒕 𝒕𝒐𝒍𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆 🛡️, and 𝒅𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒃𝒖𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒔𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒔 🌐 and it’s completely reshaping how I approach infrastructure and operations.At its core, DevOps is about optimizing the software delivery lifecycle. But here’s the thing: the effectiveness of DevOps practices is deeply tied to the quality of the system design. A well-architected system 🏗️ makes it easier to build scalable pipelines, automate deployments, and ensure reliability. On the flip side, poor design decisions like 𝒂 𝒔𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒍𝒆 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒇𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒖𝒓𝒆 ❌ or 𝒂𝒏 𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒅𝒂𝒕𝒂𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆 🐌 can create bottlenecks that no amount of automation can solve.This journey has taught me a valuable lesson: 𝑫𝙚𝒗𝙊𝒑𝙨 𝙖𝒏𝙙 𝙨𝒚𝙨𝒕𝙚𝒎 𝒅𝙚𝒔𝙞𝒈𝙣 𝙖𝒓𝙚 𝙩𝒘𝙤 𝙨𝒊𝙙𝒆𝙨 𝙤𝒇 𝒕𝙝𝒆 𝒔𝙖𝒎𝙚 𝙘𝒐𝙞𝒏. While DevOps focuses on efficiency and speed ⚡, system design ensures we’re building systems that can handle scale, resilience, and performance from the ground up.I’m curious how has learning about system design or DevOps influenced the way you approach engineering challenges?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?
