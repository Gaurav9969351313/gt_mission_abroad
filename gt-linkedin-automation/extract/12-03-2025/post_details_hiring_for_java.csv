Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?

Ryan KevelighanRyan Kevelighan,,"Spending so much time deep in one recruitment sector makes you forget the reality of how different it can be compared to other sectors as we deal with it daily.  I am now over 15 years down the line in 𝐝𝐨𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 in Australia. Yesterday I sat with two recruiters from a non-healthcare sector and it made me reflect on how different our worlds are.  Some people say recruitment is like ""𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐬"". This is also true in medical, except the cats (doctors) are highly skilled and highly paid and rightly so.  Being in high demand means the doctors often don’t really need the work that is on offer. At the senior end they can often pick and choose what they want to do and when they want to do it, meaning 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐰.  𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 do an amazing job. They often work long hours, take calls at all hours of day and night on any day of the year. Benjamin Lepke will tell you about how he once sat at the Christmas dinner table changing urgent travel for a doctor working over the festive season some years ago!  While we don’t directly save lives like the incredible doctors do, we do provide a high-end service that is often very stressful and failure has ramifications far greater than many jobs.

Igor DamianoIgor Damiano,,"🔥 Java Tip: Use the Functional Interface Predicate for Cleaner Filtering!When working with lists in Java, we often need to filter elements. Instead of writing traditional loops, we can use the functional interface Predicate to make the code more expressive and reusable.❌ Without Predicate (verbose code):```List<String> names = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"");List<String> namesWithA = new ArrayList<>();for (String name : names) { if (name.startsWith(""A"")) { namesWithA.add(name); }}System.out.println(namesWithA);```✅ With Predicate and Streams (cleaner and reusable):```Predicate<String> startsWithA = name -> name.startsWith(""A"");List<String> namesWithA = List.of(""Anna"", ""Bruno"", ""Carlos"", ""Daniel"") .stream() .filter(startsWithA) .toList();System.out.println(namesWithA);```🎯 Why use Predicate? ✔ Makes filtering logic reusable ✔ Improves code readability and maintainability ✔ Works seamlessly with Streams for a more functional approachStart using Predicate in your code and see how it improves clarity and efficiency!Do you already use Predicate in your daily coding?

Mohamed Mahmoud YoussefMohamed Mahmoud Youssef,,"There are several reasons why companies may not always hire certified & qualified engineers, despite their credentials 🤔. Here are some key factors: hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Engineering hashtag#Business hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#Challenges1. Cost ConsiderationsHighly certified engineers often demand higher salaries, which some companies may not be willing or able to pay.Companies might prefer hiring less experienced engineers at a lower cost and providing on-the-job training.2. Experience vs. CertificationMany companies prioritize practical experience over certifications. A candidate with hands-on experience but no certification may be preferred over someone who is certified but lacks real-world problem-solving skills.Some hiring managers view certifications as ""nice to have"" but not as a substitute for actual project experience.3. Skills MismatchSome engineers may have certifications that are not aligned with the company's specific needs.A certification does not always guarantee that the candidate has the required soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability.4. Industry-Specific NeedsCertain industries or companies prioritize proprietary tools and frameworks that are not covered by general certifications.Startups and fast-moving tech companies often value practical coding tests and problem-solving ability over certifications.5. Recruitment Bias & Hiring ProcessesSome HR departments and hiring managers may not fully understand the value of certifications.AI-driven or automated hiring systems may filter out qualified candidates due to rigid keyword matching.6. Internal Hiring and ReferralsMany companies prefer to hire internally or through referrals rather than going through the formal recruitment process.Internal promotions often take precedence over hiring external certified professionals.7. Lack of Hiring UrgencySome companies post job listings without an immediate hiring intention, leading to prolonged hiring cycles and making it seem like they are ignoring qualified candidates.8. Market SaturationIn fields like cybersecurity, software development, and DevOps, there are often more applicants than available jobs, leading to tough competition even for qualified candidates.What Can You Do?If you're facing challenges in getting hired despite your certifications, consider:Gaining more hands-on experience through freelance projects or open-source contributions.Networking with professionals and attending industry events.Tailoring your resume to highlight real-world projects rather than just certifications.Improving soft skills like communication and leadership, which many employers value highly.Would you like help in optimizing your job search strategy?
