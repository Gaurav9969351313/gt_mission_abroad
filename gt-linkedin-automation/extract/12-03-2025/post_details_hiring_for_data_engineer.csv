Putra Nur AfiqPutra Nur Afiq,,"🚨 MedTech Alert: Siemens Expands Photon-Counting CT & What This Means for APAC Hiring! 🚨 Big news in the medical imaging world, Siemens Healthineers has just expanded its photon-counting CT (PCCT) lineup with new FDA clearances. With the launch of Naeotom Alpha Pro & Alpha Prime, this next-gen imaging technology is set to transform radiology, emergency care, and AI-driven diagnostics.🌏 But what does this mean for healthcare and MedTech talent in APAC?1️⃣ Surging Demand for Imaging & Radiology TalentAs hospitals and clinics upgrade to photon-counting CT, we’ll see a higher demand for radiologists, imaging specialists, and biomedical engineers who can operate and interpret these advanced scans. Those with AI and dual-source CT expertise will be highly sought after.2️⃣ The Rise of AI & Automation in DiagnosticsSiemens Healthineers is integrating AI-driven workflow automation, which means MedTech companies will compete for AI engineers, machine learning experts, and medical data analysts to enhance imaging efficiency.

Lydia C.Lydia C.,,"🎥 If Content Creation Isn’t a Real Business, Then Neither Is Netflix.Every few months, someone says:“Being a content creator isn’t a real job.”Yet those same people respect billion-dollar media companies like:✅ Disney (Creates entertainment and monetizes it across platforms—just like content creators.)✅ Netflix (Built a business on subscriptions—just like Patreon & membership-based creators.)✅ The Wall Street Journal (Sells paywalled content—just like Substack & premium newsletters.)Same business model. Different medium.The only real difference between a content creator and these companies? Scale.🎬 Creators Are the New Media CompaniesCreators aren’t just “posting online.” They’re building media companies in real-time.Here’s What People Don’t Realize:📡 Creators own their distribution.- No network deals. No publishing gatekeepers.- Their audience is their platform.💰 Creators monetize like businesses.- Ads, sponsorships, memberships, consulting—it’s all revenue streams.- The same way traditional media profits from subscriptions & advertising.👑 Creators are CEOs.- They run marketing, branding, production, partnerships, and sales—all on their own.- They scale by hiring teams, automating workflows, and diversifying income.📊 The Data Speaks for ItselfAnd the numbers prove it (shoutout to Tyler Chou is at SXSW for breaking these down!):📈 The creator economy is projected to hit nearly $500B by 2027 (Goldman Sachs).→ That’s on par with the entire film, music, and publishing industries.👥 12M people in the U.S. make a full-time living as creators—more than all doctors, lawyers, engineers, and teachers combined.→ This isn’t a niche—it’s a workforce.💰 MrBeast’s brand is valued at $5B—on par with companies like Spotify, Etsy, and Shake Shack.→ One creator’s business is worth as much as publicly traded corporations.💵 Many full-time creators earn six figures a year, with top creators scaling into millions.→ This isn’t a hobby. It’s a legitimate career path.🌟 So What’s the Real Difference?The biggest creators are building media empires—without the corporate middlemen.And that’s exactly why some people still don’t take them seriously.Because the old system was built on gatekeepers.But the internet changed the game. Creators don’t need permission. They don’t need approval.And they definitely don’t need someone else to tell them their work is “real.”Like it or not, creators aren’t just building careers. They’re building industries.-💬 What’s one creator that made you realize content creation is a real business?-Day 21/90 of Tyler’s hashtag#LinkedinWriting Challenge hashtag#CreatorEconomy hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#MonetizingContent hashtag#OnePersonBusiness

Putra Nur AfiqPutra Nur Afiq,,"🚨 MedTech Alert: Siemens Expands Photon-Counting CT & What This Means for APAC Hiring! 🚨 Big news in the medical imaging world, Siemens Healthineers has just expanded its photon-counting CT (PCCT) lineup with new FDA clearances. With the launch of Naeotom Alpha Pro & Alpha Prime, this next-gen imaging technology is set to transform radiology, emergency care, and AI-driven diagnostics.🌏 But what does this mean for healthcare and MedTech talent in APAC?1️⃣ Surging Demand for Imaging & Radiology TalentAs hospitals and clinics upgrade to photon-counting CT, we’ll see a higher demand for radiologists, imaging specialists, and biomedical engineers who can operate and interpret these advanced scans. Those with AI and dual-source CT expertise will be highly sought after.2️⃣ The Rise of AI & Automation in DiagnosticsSiemens Healthineers is integrating AI-driven workflow automation, which means MedTech companies will compete for AI engineers, machine learning experts, and medical data analysts to enhance imaging efficiency. Radiologists must also adapt to AI-assisted diagnostics, creating new hybrid roles in the industry.3️⃣ APAC Expansion = More Commercial & Technical HiringWith SEA, China, and India being high-growth MedTech markets, expect to see more hiring in sales, applications support, business development, and technical service roles as companies push to capture market share.4️⃣ Competitive Pressure & Talent Retention ChallengesAs Siemens leads the charge, GE HealthCare, Philips, and Canon Medical Systems Corporation will respond with their own innovations. This will intensify the competition for MedTech talent, making employee retention, compensation, and career development even more critical for companies in the space.5️⃣ The Shift Toward Emergency & Ambulatory ImagingWith the Naeotom Alpha Prime designed for emergency rooms and outpatient settings, demand will rise for mobile radiology specialists, telemedicine-imaging consultants, and diagnostic imaging talent in non-hospital environments.💡 What’s Next?MedTech companies are intensifying their search for top imaging and AI talent, while candidates should focus on upskilling in AI-driven diagnostics and CT technologies. As a healthcare & life sciences recruiter in Singapore & APAC, I connect top talent with leading MedTech innovators, let’s connect if you're hiring or seeking new opportunities!🔗 Read more here: https://lnkd.in/g7rNabVARandstad Singapore hashtag#MedTech hashtag#MedicalImaging hashtag#PhotonCountingCT hashtag#Radiology hashtag#TalentInsights

Lydia C.Lydia C.,,"🎥 If Content Creation Isn’t a Real Business, Then Neither Is Netflix.Every few months, someone says:“Being a content creator isn’t a real job.”Yet those same people respect billion-dollar media companies like:✅ Disney (Creates entertainment and monetizes it across platforms—just like content creators.)✅ Netflix (Built a business on subscriptions—just like Patreon & membership-based creators.)✅ The Wall Street Journal (Sells paywalled content—just like Substack & premium newsletters.)Same business model. Different medium.The only real difference between a content creator and these companies? Scale.🎬 Creators Are the New Media CompaniesCreators aren’t just “posting online.” They’re building media companies in real-time.Here’s What People Don’t Realize:📡 Creators own their distribution.- No network deals. No publishing gatekeepers.- Their audience is their platform.💰 Creators monetize like businesses.- Ads, sponsorships, memberships, consulting—it’s all revenue streams.- The same way traditional media profits from subscriptions & advertising.👑 Creators are CEOs.- They run marketing, branding, production, partnerships, and sales—all on their own.- They scale by hiring teams, automating workflows, and diversifying income.📊 The Data Speaks for ItselfAnd the numbers prove it (shoutout to Tyler Chou is at SXSW for breaking these down!):📈 The creator economy is projected to hit nearly $500B by 2027 (Goldman Sachs).→ That’s on par with the entire film, music, and publishing industries.👥 12M people in the U.S. make a full-time living as creators—more than all doctors, lawyers, engineers, and teachers combined.→ This isn’t a niche—it’s a workforce.💰 MrBeast’s brand is valued at $5B—on par with companies like Spotify, Etsy, and Shake Shack.→ One creator’s business is worth as much as publicly traded corporations.💵 Many full-time creators earn six figures a year, with top creators scaling into millions.→ This isn’t a hobby. It’s a legitimate career path.🌟 So What’s the Real Difference?The biggest creators are building media empires—without the corporate middlemen.And that’s exactly why some people still don’t take them seriously.Because the old system was built on gatekeepers.But the internet changed the game. Creators don’t need permission. They don’t need approval.And they definitely don’t need someone else to tell them their work is “real.”Like it or not, creators aren’t just building careers. They’re building industries.-💬 What’s one creator that made you realize content creation is a real business?-Day 21/90 of Tyler’s hashtag#LinkedinWriting Challenge hashtag#CreatorEconomy hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#MonetizingContent hashtag#OnePersonBusiness

With the launch of Naeotom Alpha Pro & Alpha Prime, this next-gen imaging technology is set to transform radiology, emergency care, and AI-driven diagnostics.🌏 But what does this mean for healthcare and MedTech talent in APAC?1️⃣ Surging Demand for Imaging & Radiology TalentAs hospitals and clinics upgrade to photon-counting CT, we’ll see a higher demand for radiologists, imaging specialists, and biomedical engineers who can operate and interpret these advanced scans. Those with AI and dual-source CT expertise will be highly sought after.2️⃣ The Rise of AI & Automation in DiagnosticsSiemens Healthineers is integrating AI-driven workflow automation, which means MedTech companies will compete for AI engineers, machine learning experts, and medical data analysts to enhance imaging efficiency. Radiologists must also adapt to AI-assisted diagnostics, creating new hybrid roles in the industry.3️⃣ APAC Expansion = More Commercial & Technical HiringWith SEA, China, and India being high-growth MedTech markets, expect to see more hiring in sales, applications support, business development, and technical service roles as companies push to capture market share.4️⃣ Competitive Pressure & Talent Retention ChallengesAs Siemens leads the charge, GE HealthCare, Philips, and Canon Medical Systems Corporation will respond with their own innovations. This will intensify the competition for MedTech talent, making employee retention, compensation, and career development even more critical for companies in the space.5️⃣ The Shift Toward Emergency & Ambulatory ImagingWith the Naeotom Alpha Prime designed for emergency rooms and outpatient settings, demand will rise for mobile radiology specialists, telemedicine-imaging consultants, and diagnostic imaging talent in non-hospital environments.💡 What’s Next?MedTech companies are intensifying their search for top imaging and AI talent, while candidates should focus on upskilling in AI-driven diagnostics and CT technologies. As a healthcare & life sciences recruiter in Singapore & APAC, I connect top talent with leading MedTech innovators, let’s connect if you're hiring or seeking new opportunities!🔗 Read more here: https://lnkd.in/g7rNabVARandstad Singapore hashtag#MedTech hashtag#MedicalImaging hashtag#PhotonCountingCT hashtag#Radiology hashtag#TalentInsights

Lydia C.Lydia C.,,"🎥 If Content Creation Isn’t a Real Business, Then Neither Is Netflix.Every few months, someone says:“Being a content creator isn’t a real job.”Yet those same people respect billion-dollar media companies like:✅ Disney (Creates entertainment and monetizes it across platforms—just like content creators.)✅ Netflix (Built a business on subscriptions—just like Patreon & membership-based creators.)✅ The Wall Street Journal (Sells paywalled content—just like Substack & premium newsletters.)Same business model. Different medium.The only real difference between a content creator and these companies? Scale.🎬 Creators Are the New Media CompaniesCreators aren’t just “posting online.” They’re building media companies in real-time.Here’s What People Don’t Realize:📡 Creators own their distribution.- No network deals. No publishing gatekeepers.- Their audience is their platform.💰 Creators monetize like businesses.- Ads, sponsorships, memberships, consulting—it’s all revenue streams.- The same way traditional media profits from subscriptions & advertising.👑 Creators are CEOs.- They run marketing, branding, production, partnerships, and sales—all on their own.- They scale by hiring teams, automating workflows, and diversifying income.📊 The Data Speaks for ItselfAnd the numbers prove it (shoutout to Tyler Chou is at SXSW for breaking these down!):📈 The creator economy is projected to hit nearly $500B by 2027 (Goldman Sachs).→ That’s on par with the entire film, music, and publishing industries.👥 12M people in the U.S. make a full-time living as creators—more than all doctors, lawyers, engineers, and teachers combined.→ This isn’t a niche—it’s a workforce.💰 MrBeast’s brand is valued at $5B—on par with companies like Spotify, Etsy, and Shake Shack.→ One creator’s business is worth as much as publicly traded corporations.💵 Many full-time creators earn six figures a year, with top creators scaling into millions.→ This isn’t a hobby. It’s a legitimate career path.🌟 So What’s the Real Difference?The biggest creators are building media empires—without the corporate middlemen.And that’s exactly why some people still don’t take them seriously.Because the old system was built on gatekeepers.But the internet changed the game. Creators don’t need permission. They don’t need approval.And they definitely don’t need someone else to tell them their work is “real.”Like it or not, creators aren’t just building careers. They’re building industries.-💬 What’s one creator that made you realize content creation is a real business?-Day 21/90 of Tyler’s hashtag#LinkedinWriting Challenge hashtag#CreatorEconomy hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#MonetizingContent hashtag#OnePersonBusiness

Radiologists must also adapt to AI-assisted diagnostics, creating new hybrid roles in the industry.3️⃣ APAC Expansion = More Commercial & Technical HiringWith SEA, China, and India being high-growth MedTech markets, expect to see more hiring in sales, applications support, business development, and technical service roles as companies push to capture market share.4️⃣ Competitive Pressure & Talent Retention ChallengesAs Siemens leads the charge, GE HealthCare, Philips, and Canon Medical Systems Corporation will respond with their own innovations. This will intensify the competition for MedTech talent, making employee retention, compensation, and career development even more critical for companies in the space.5️⃣ The Shift Toward Emergency & Ambulatory ImagingWith the Naeotom Alpha Prime designed for emergency rooms and outpatient settings, demand will rise for mobile radiology specialists, telemedicine-imaging consultants, and diagnostic imaging talent in non-hospital environments.💡 What’s Next?MedTech companies are intensifying their search for top imaging and AI talent, while candidates should focus on upskilling in AI-driven diagnostics and CT technologies. As a healthcare & life sciences recruiter in Singapore & APAC, I connect top talent with leading MedTech innovators, let’s connect if you're hiring or seeking new opportunities!🔗 Read more here: https://lnkd.in/g7rNabVARandstad Singapore hashtag#MedTech hashtag#MedicalImaging hashtag#PhotonCountingCT hashtag#Radiology hashtag#TalentInsights

Lydia C.Lydia C.,,"🎥 If Content Creation Isn’t a Real Business, Then Neither Is Netflix.Every few months, someone says:“Being a content creator isn’t a real job.”Yet those same people respect billion-dollar media companies like:✅ Disney (Creates entertainment and monetizes it across platforms—just like content creators.)✅ Netflix (Built a business on subscriptions—just like Patreon & membership-based creators.)✅ The Wall Street Journal (Sells paywalled content—just like Substack & premium newsletters.)Same business model. Different medium.The only real difference between a content creator and these companies? Scale.🎬 Creators Are the New Media CompaniesCreators aren’t just “posting online.” They’re building media companies in real-time.Here’s What People Don’t Realize:📡 Creators own their distribution.- No network deals. No publishing gatekeepers.- Their audience is their platform.💰 Creators monetize like businesses.- Ads, sponsorships, memberships, consulting—it’s all revenue streams.- The same way traditional media profits from subscriptions & advertising.👑 Creators are CEOs.- They run marketing, branding, production, partnerships, and sales—all on their own.- They scale by hiring teams, automating workflows, and diversifying income.📊 The Data Speaks for ItselfAnd the numbers prove it (shoutout to Tyler Chou is at SXSW for breaking these down!):📈 The creator economy is projected to hit nearly $500B by 2027 (Goldman Sachs).→ That’s on par with the entire film, music, and publishing industries.👥 12M people in the U.S. make a full-time living as creators—more than all doctors, lawyers, engineers, and teachers combined.→ This isn’t a niche—it’s a workforce.💰 MrBeast’s brand is valued at $5B—on par with companies like Spotify, Etsy, and Shake Shack.→ One creator’s business is worth as much as publicly traded corporations.💵 Many full-time creators earn six figures a year, with top creators scaling into millions.→ This isn’t a hobby. It’s a legitimate career path.🌟 So What’s the Real Difference?The biggest creators are building media empires—without the corporate middlemen.And that’s exactly why some people still don’t take them seriously.Because the old system was built on gatekeepers.But the internet changed the game. Creators don’t need permission. They don’t need approval.And they definitely don’t need someone else to tell them their work is “real.”Like it or not, creators aren’t just building careers. They’re building industries.-💬 What’s one creator that made you realize content creation is a real business?-Day 21/90 of Tyler’s hashtag#LinkedinWriting Challenge hashtag#CreatorEconomy hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#MonetizingContent hashtag#OnePersonBusiness

Putra Nur AfiqPutra Nur Afiq,,"🚨 MedTech Alert: Siemens Expands Photon-Counting CT & What This Means for APAC Hiring! 🚨 Big news in the medical imaging world, Siemens Healthineers has just expanded its photon-counting CT (PCCT) lineup with new FDA clearances. With the launch of Naeotom Alpha Pro & Alpha Prime, this next-gen imaging technology is set to transform radiology, emergency care, and AI-driven diagnostics.🌏 But what does this mean for healthcare and MedTech talent in APAC?1️⃣ Surging Demand for Imaging & Radiology TalentAs hospitals and clinics upgrade to photon-counting CT, we’ll see a higher demand for radiologists, imaging specialists, and biomedical engineers who can operate and interpret these advanced scans. Those with AI and dual-source CT expertise will be highly sought after.2️⃣ The Rise of AI & Automation in DiagnosticsSiemens Healthineers is integrating AI-driven workflow automation, which means MedTech companies will compete for AI engineers, machine learning experts, and medical data analysts to enhance imaging efficiency. Radiologists must also adapt to AI-assisted diagnostics, creating new hybrid roles in the industry.3️⃣ APAC Expansion = More Commercial & Technical HiringWith SEA, China, and India being high-growth MedTech markets, expect to see more hiring in sales, applications support, business development, and technical service roles as companies push to capture market share.4️⃣ Competitive Pressure & Talent Retention ChallengesAs Siemens leads the charge, GE HealthCare, Philips, and Canon Medical Systems Corporation will respond with their own innovations. This will intensify the competition for MedTech talent, making employee retention, compensation, and career development even more critical for companies in the space.5️⃣ The Shift Toward Emergency & Ambulatory ImagingWith the Naeotom Alpha Prime designed for emergency rooms and outpatient settings, demand will rise for mobile radiology specialists, telemedicine-imaging consultants, and diagnostic imaging talent in non-hospital environments.💡 What’s Next?MedTech companies are intensifying their search for top imaging and AI talent, while candidates should focus on upskilling in AI-driven diagnostics and CT technologies. As a healthcare & life sciences recruiter in Singapore & APAC, I connect top talent with leading MedTech innovators, let’s connect if you're hiring or seeking new opportunities!🔗 Read more here: https://lnkd.in/g7rNabVARandstad Singapore hashtag#MedTech hashtag#MedicalImaging hashtag#PhotonCountingCT hashtag#Radiology hashtag#TalentInsights

Lydia C.Lydia C.,,"🎥 If Content Creation Isn’t a Real Business, Then Neither Is Netflix.Every few months, someone says:“Being a content creator isn’t a real job.”Yet those same people respect billion-dollar media companies like:✅ Disney (Creates entertainment and monetizes it across platforms—just like content creators.)✅ Netflix (Built a business on subscriptions—just like Patreon & membership-based creators.)✅ The Wall Street Journal (Sells paywalled content—just like Substack & premium newsletters.)Same business model. Different medium.The only real difference between a content creator and these companies? Scale.🎬 Creators Are the New Media CompaniesCreators aren’t just “posting online.” They’re building media companies in real-time.Here’s What People Don’t Realize:📡 Creators own their distribution.- No network deals. No publishing gatekeepers.- Their audience is their platform.💰 Creators monetize like businesses.- Ads, sponsorships, memberships, consulting—it’s all revenue streams.- The same way traditional media profits from subscriptions & advertising.👑 Creators are CEOs.- They run marketing, branding, production, partnerships, and sales—all on their own.- They scale by hiring teams, automating workflows, and diversifying income.📊 The Data Speaks for ItselfAnd the numbers prove it (shoutout to Tyler Chou is at SXSW for breaking these down!):📈 The creator economy is projected to hit nearly $500B by 2027 (Goldman Sachs).→ That’s on par with the entire film, music, and publishing industries.👥 12M people in the U.S. make a full-time living as creators—more than all doctors, lawyers, engineers, and teachers combined.→ This isn’t a niche—it’s a workforce.💰 MrBeast’s brand is valued at $5B—on par with companies like Spotify, Etsy, and Shake Shack.→ One creator’s business is worth as much as publicly traded corporations.💵 Many full-time creators earn six figures a year, with top creators scaling into millions.→ This isn’t a hobby. It’s a legitimate career path.🌟 So What’s the Real Difference?The biggest creators are building media empires—without the corporate middlemen.And that’s exactly why some people still don’t take them seriously.Because the old system was built on gatekeepers.But the internet changed the game. Creators don’t need permission. They don’t need approval.And they definitely don’t need someone else to tell them their work is “real.”Like it or not, creators aren’t just building careers. They’re building industries.-💬 What’s one creator that made you realize content creation is a real business?-Day 21/90 of Tyler’s hashtag#LinkedinWriting Challenge hashtag#CreatorEconomy hashtag#DigitalMarketing hashtag#MonetizingContent hashtag#OnePersonBusiness
