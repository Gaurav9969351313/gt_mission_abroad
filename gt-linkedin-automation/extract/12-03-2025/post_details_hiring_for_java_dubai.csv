Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Mohammed AhmedMohammed Ahmed,,"# 13 Tips for Auditing Real Estate  across UAE: 1. Ensure compliance with UAE real estate laws RERA (Dubai), ADREC (Abu Dhabi), and other emirate-specific requirements such as real estate policies and governance frameworks.2.  Cross-check legal ownership with the land department and validate any encumbrances or liens.3. Assess rental contracts, lease terms, and revenue recognition (IFRS 16) to ensure accuracy.4. Evaluate Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) and repair agreements for completeness, cost reasonableness, and adherence to service-level agreements (SLAs).5. Review payments to vendors and AMC providers to confirm they align with contract terms, approved budgets, and service quality expectations. Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Mohammed AhmedMohammed Ahmed,,"# 13 Tips for Auditing Real Estate  across UAE: 1. Ensure compliance with UAE real estate laws RERA (Dubai), ADREC (Abu Dhabi), and other emirate-specific requirements such as real estate policies and governance frameworks.2.  Cross-check legal ownership with the land department and validate any encumbrances or liens.3. Assess rental contracts, lease terms, and revenue recognition (IFRS 16) to ensure accuracy.4. Evaluate Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) and repair agreements for completeness, cost reasonableness, and adherence to service-level agreements (SLAs).5. Review payments to vendors and AMC providers to confirm they align with contract terms, approved budgets, and service quality expectations. Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Mohammed AhmedMohammed Ahmed,,"# 13 Tips for Auditing Real Estate  across UAE: 1. Ensure compliance with UAE real estate laws RERA (Dubai), ADREC (Abu Dhabi), and other emirate-specific requirements such as real estate policies and governance frameworks.2.  Cross-check legal ownership with the land department and validate any encumbrances or liens.3. Assess rental contracts, lease terms, and revenue recognition (IFRS 16) to ensure accuracy.4. Evaluate Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMC) and repair agreements for completeness, cost reasonableness, and adherence to service-level agreements (SLAs).5. Review payments to vendors and AMC providers to confirm they align with contract terms, approved budgets, and service quality expectations. Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

They focus on matching the right talent with the right opportunity, not just making quick placements.✅ Honest recruiters:🔹 Provide realistic expectations about the market, commissions, and job demands.🔹 Connect candidates with the right company culture, not just any available role.🔹 Offer long-term support rather than disappearing after a placement.If you’re in Dubai’s real estate industry 🏙️, whether as an employer or a job seeker, aligning with the right recruiter can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress.Let’s recognize and appreciate the recruiters who prioritize integrity over quick deals. They are the ones shaping a stronger, more professional real estate market in Dubai! 💼👏hashtag#RealEstateDubai 🏡 hashtag#Recruitment 🤝 hashtag#HonestHiring ✅ hashtag#DubaiJobs 🇦🇪 hashtag#CareerGrowth 🚀

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

However, the difference between a transactional recruiter and an honest, value-driven recruiter is massive.A true recruiter doesn’t just fill vacancies—they build careers and strengthen companies. They focus on matching the right talent with the right opportunity, not just making quick placements.✅ Honest recruiters:🔹 Provide realistic expectations about the market, commissions, and job demands.🔹 Connect candidates with the right company culture, not just any available role.🔹 Offer long-term support rather than disappearing after a placement.If you’re in Dubai’s real estate industry 🏙️, whether as an employer or a job seeker, aligning with the right recruiter can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress.Let’s recognize and appreciate the recruiters who prioritize integrity over quick deals.

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention? And more importantly—who’s following suit?hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Futurism hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Leadership hashtag#WorkplaceTrends hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#WorkFromAnywhere hashtag#UAEInnovation hashtag#WorkplaceWellbeing hashtag#WorkRevolution

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention? And more importantly—who’s following suit?hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Futurism hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Leadership hashtag#WorkplaceTrends hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#WorkFromAnywhere hashtag#UAEInnovation hashtag#WorkplaceWellbeing hashtag#WorkRevolution

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

They focus on matching the right talent with the right opportunity, not just making quick placements.✅ Honest recruiters:🔹 Provide realistic expectations about the market, commissions, and job demands.🔹 Connect candidates with the right company culture, not just any available role.🔹 Offer long-term support rather than disappearing after a placement.If you’re in Dubai’s real estate industry 🏙️, whether as an employer or a job seeker, aligning with the right recruiter can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress.Let’s recognize and appreciate the recruiters who prioritize integrity over quick deals. They are the ones shaping a stronger, more professional real estate market in Dubai! 💼👏hashtag#RealEstateDubai 🏡 hashtag#Recruitment 🤝 hashtag#HonestHiring ✅ hashtag#DubaiJobs 🇦🇪 hashtag#CareerGrowth 🚀

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention? And more importantly—who’s following suit?hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Futurism hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Leadership hashtag#WorkplaceTrends hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#WorkFromAnywhere hashtag#UAEInnovation hashtag#WorkplaceWellbeing hashtag#WorkRevolution

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention? And more importantly—who’s following suit?hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Futurism hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Leadership hashtag#WorkplaceTrends hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#WorkFromAnywhere hashtag#UAEInnovation hashtag#WorkplaceWellbeing hashtag#WorkRevolution

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention? And more importantly—who’s following suit?hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Futurism hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Leadership hashtag#WorkplaceTrends hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#WorkFromAnywhere hashtag#UAEInnovation hashtag#WorkplaceWellbeing hashtag#WorkRevolution

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention? And more importantly—who’s following suit?hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Futurism hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Leadership hashtag#WorkplaceTrends hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#WorkFromAnywhere hashtag#UAEInnovation hashtag#WorkplaceWellbeing hashtag#WorkRevolution

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

They focus on matching the right talent with the right opportunity, not just making quick placements.✅ Honest recruiters:🔹 Provide realistic expectations about the market, commissions, and job demands.🔹 Connect candidates with the right company culture, not just any available role.🔹 Offer long-term support rather than disappearing after a placement.If you’re in Dubai’s real estate industry 🏙️, whether as an employer or a job seeker, aligning with the right recruiter can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress.Let’s recognize and appreciate the recruiters who prioritize integrity over quick deals. They are the ones shaping a stronger, more professional real estate market in Dubai! 💼👏hashtag#RealEstateDubai 🏡 hashtag#Recruitment 🤝 hashtag#HonestHiring ✅ hashtag#DubaiJobs 🇦🇪 hashtag#CareerGrowth 🚀

Dr Mohammad AlketbiDr Mohammad Alketbi,,"Dubai Once Again Redefines Innovation with Groundbreaking Traffic Management System🚦Dubai ​Roads and Transport Authority​ (RTA) continues to solidify the UAE’s reputation as a global pioneer in visionary urban solutions. By launching the UTC-UX Fusion, an AI-driven traffic signal control system, Dubai isn’t merely adopting emerging technologies—it’s setting a new standard for cities worldwide. This system integrates predictive analytics, self-learning algorithms, and digital twin simulations before they become mainstream, embodying the UAE’s ethos of leading from the front. Why This Matters:The UAE’s leadership has always prioritized audacious innovation over incremental progress. From autonomous air taxis to hyperloop concepts, Dubai operates as a living laboratory for transformative ideas. The UTC-UX Fusion exemplifies this mindset: it’s not just about solving today’s traffic challenges but redefining how cities interact with mobility itself. Key Innovations: ✅ Adaptive Traffic Signals: AI adjusts signal timings in real-time, dynamically optimizing traffic flow to reduce congestion.  ✅ Predictive Gridlock Prevention:Machine learning forecasts bottlenecks hours in advance, enabling proactive adjustments.  ✅ Digital Twin Simulations: A virtual replica of Dubai’s road network allows risk-free testing of radical traffic strategies. A Blueprint for Global Cities:Dubai’s willingness to deploy untested, scalable solutions transforms urban complexities into opportunities for leadership. This project transcends smoother commutes—it’s a testament to the power of fearless experimentation. As the saying goes: Innovation doesn’t need a roadmap when you’re building the road yourself.What are your thoughts on cities taking bold risks to pioneer new technologies?hashtag#mobility hashtag#Innovation hashtag#TrafficManagement

Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention? And more importantly—who’s following suit?hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#Futurism hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Leadership hashtag#WorkplaceTrends hashtag#GlobalTalent hashtag#WorkFromAnywhere hashtag#UAEInnovation hashtag#WorkplaceWellbeing hashtag#WorkRevolution

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Kinan MayalaKinan Mayala,,"The Value of Honest Recruiters 🏡In Dubai’s competitive real estate market, the role of recruiters is more critical than ever. However, the difference between a transactional recruiter and an honest, value-driven recruiter is massive.A true recruiter doesn’t just fill vacancies—they build careers and strengthen companies. They focus on matching the right talent with the right opportunity, not just making quick placements.✅ Honest recruiters:🔹 Provide realistic expectations about the market, commissions, and job demands.🔹 Connect candidates with the right company culture, not just any available role.🔹 Offer long-term support rather than disappearing after a placement.If you’re in Dubai’s real estate industry 🏙️, whether as an employer or a job seeker, aligning with the right recruiter can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress.Let’s recognize and appreciate the recruiters who prioritize integrity over quick deals.

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bochra Ben RomdhaneBochra Ben Romdhane,,"One thing I’ve learned in real estate—connectivity changes everything. And Dubai’s new Gold Line Metro is about to do just that.This new metro line will link Business Bay, Meydan, Global Village, and Dubailand, but the real impact? Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC) and the surrounding communities.Properties near metro stations in Dubai outperform in the market. Between 2010 and 2022, prices for properties within walking distance of a metro station increased by 26.7%, while rental rates in these areas grew 5.7% from 2018 to 2022—even when the overall market saw a decline. That’s the power of accessibility.For areas surrounding JVC, this means:🏡 Property values are likely to rise📈 Stronger demand from investors & renters🚆 Easier commutes & less traffic for residentsThis isn’t just about numbers—it’s about how people live. The easier it is to move around, the more attractive a community becomes. I’ve seen it happen time and time again, and I have no doubt JVC is about to experience a surge in interest.

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Kinan MayalaKinan Mayala,,"The Value of Honest Recruiters 🏡In Dubai’s competitive real estate market, the role of recruiters is more critical than ever. However, the difference between a transactional recruiter and an honest, value-driven recruiter is massive.A true recruiter doesn’t just fill vacancies—they build careers and strengthen companies. They focus on matching the right talent with the right opportunity, not just making quick placements.✅ Honest recruiters:🔹 Provide realistic expectations about the market, commissions, and job demands.🔹 Connect candidates with the right company culture, not just any available role.🔹 Offer long-term support rather than disappearing after a placement.If you’re in Dubai’s real estate industry 🏙️, whether as an employer or a job seeker, aligning with the right recruiter can save you time, money, and unnecessary stress.Let’s recognize and appreciate the recruiters who prioritize integrity over quick deals.

And Dubai’s new Gold Line Metro is about to do just that.This new metro line will link Business Bay, Meydan, Global Village, and Dubailand, but the real impact? Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC) and the surrounding communities.Properties near metro stations in Dubai outperform in the market. Between 2010 and 2022, prices for properties within walking distance of a metro station increased by 26.7%, while rental rates in these areas grew 5.7% from 2018 to 2022—even when the overall market saw a decline. That’s the power of accessibility.For areas surrounding JVC, this means:🏡 Property values are likely to rise📈 Stronger demand from investors & renters🚆 Easier commutes & less traffic for residentsThis isn’t just about numbers—it’s about how people live. The easier it is to move around, the more attractive a community becomes. I’ve seen it happen time and time again, and I have no doubt JVC is about to experience a surge in interest.

Bobbi HartshorneBobbi Hartshorne,,"The UAE just casually rewrote the rulebook on work. Again!One of the things I love (and deeply respect) about the hashtag#UAE is how they periodically drop game-changing policies with quiet confidence—no fuss, no noise, just commit and go. ⏩ ⏩ ⏩ While some leaders are still clinging to outdated return-to-office mandates, the UAE has just greenlit remote work from OUTSIDE the country for federal employees—a move that doesn’t just disrupt traditional employment structures but trivialises the very idea of location-based work. Hurrah to that!!! 🥳 And here’s the thing—this won’t have been a shot in the dark.Knowing the UAE (having lived and worked there for 12 years), this decision will be backed by data from their 4.5-day workweek implementation, insights from global talent trends, and a futurist lens that ensures they’re always ahead of the curve rather than scrambling to catch up. 📈 The UAE just delivered a masterclass in leadership: ✅ Informed, strategic decision-making ✅ Calculated risk-taking with both macro and micro perspectives in mind ✅ No fear, no resistance, no half measures—just bold, decisive actionIsn't it refreshing? 🍋 The UAE is moving forward, while so many others are stuck looking back.And, in answer to Ahmed AlDhraif's question - Would you work for a government remotely? Having had the great priviedge of working with a number of directors across UAE government departments, I have experienced first hand how innovative, progressive, and future-focussed they are. As progress is one of the lynchpins of employee wellbeing as demonstrated in 'The Progress Principle' which explores how making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful driver of motivation, creativity, and positive emotions in employees, it's a hard 'yes' from me! I cannot wait to see what results they achieve with this move. It will be a fascinating study!The question is, who’s paying attention?

Verify approvals and supporting documentation before processing payments.6. Examine internal approval workflows for vendor payments, maintenance expenses, and capital expenditures. Ensure segregation of duties and compliance with procurement policies.7. Scrutinize expense allocations for maintenance, security, and utilities, ensuring transparency and fair distribution among tenants.8. Review accounts receivable, aging reports, and tenant payment histories. Identify overdue payments, assess bad debt provisions, and evaluate collection efforts.9. Ensure service-level agreements (SLAs) between legal and collections teams are well-defined, outlining responsibilities, escalation procedures, and expected response times for disputes or overdue payments.10. Evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each building to assess financial performance.11. Track expense trends, looking for any unexplained significant increases, and investigate the justification for those increases.12. Check vacancy rates and the effectiveness of marketing strategies in addressing vacancy issues.13. Ensure there is a structured process for handling tenant and owner complaints, with clear reporting lines. Also, monitor any cases filed with Baladiya and ensure timely responses and legal compliance.MA😊

Bochra Ben RomdhaneBochra Ben Romdhane,,"One thing I’ve learned in real estate—connectivity changes everything. And Dubai’s new Gold Line Metro is about to do just that.This new metro line will link Business Bay, Meydan, Global Village, and Dubailand, but the real impact? Jumeirah Village Circle (JVC) and the surrounding communities.Properties near metro stations in Dubai outperform in the market. Between 2010 and 2022, prices for properties within walking distance of a metro station increased by 26.7%, while rental rates in these areas grew 5.7% from 2018 to 2022—even when the overall market saw a decline. That’s the power of accessibility.For areas surrounding JVC, this means:🏡 Property values are likely to rise📈 Stronger demand from investors & renters🚆 Easier commutes & less traffic for residentsThis isn’t just about numbers—it’s about how people live. The easier it is to move around, the more attractive a community becomes. I’ve seen it happen time and time again, and I have no doubt JVC is about to experience a surge in interest.
