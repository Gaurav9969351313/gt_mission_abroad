Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Moises MataMoises Mata,,"🔥 ¿Realmente buscan talento o solo juegan con los candidatos?Después de varios procesos de selección, entrevistas y pruebas técnicas, quiero hablar de algo que, aunque todos sabemos que pasa, parece que nadie quiere decirlo en voz alta.✅ El guion siempre es el mismo:🔹 “¡Nos urge cerrar la vacante!”🔹 “Tu perfil es justo lo que buscamos.”🔹 “El proceso será rápido.”Te emocionas, te preparas, pasas entrevistas y pruebas técnicas (a veces largas y no pagadas)… y luego viene el infame silencio:❌ Correos sin responder.❌ Visto en WhatsApp.❌ Llamadas ignoradas.Y si logras que te respondan, siempre es la misma historia:🔸 “El cliente aún no decide.” (pero siguen entrevistando más gente)🔸 “El cliente canceló la vacante.” (pero sigue publicada una y otra vez)🔸 “Tu perfil es excelente, pero queremos evaluar más opciones.” (traducción: quieren pagar menos)🔸 “Estamos esperando aprobación.” (y seis meses después, la misma vacante sigue publicada)💼 Algunas verdades incómodas:📌 Piden 10 años de experiencia en tecnologías que existen hace 5.📌 Vacantes “urgentes” que terminan en procesos eternos o que mágicamente desaparecen.📌 Exigen un perfil Full Stack, pero con responsabilidades de DevOps, QA, SysAdmin y hasta Scrum Master, por un sueldo que apenas supera al de un becario.📌 Múltiples entrevistas, pruebas técnicas absurdas y exámenes interminables, solo para que al final elijan a alguien más barato o el proceso se cancele sin ninguna explicación.📌 “Buscamos el match perfecto”, pero cuando el candidato pide un sueldo acorde a su experiencia, mágicamente el presupuesto se reduce.📌 Piden honestidad en los CVs, pero no dan feedback, no responden mensajes y dejan a los candidatos en el limbo.💡 Entonces, ¿falta talento o falta estrategia en el reclutamiento?Se habla de escasez de talento, pero lo que realmente hay es:🚩 Procesos de selección mal estructurados.🚩 Expectativas irreales y sueldos que no corresponden con la experiencia requerida.🚩 Falta de compromiso con los candidatos.💼 A los reclutadores y headhunters:Si una vacante sigue abierta durante meses o años, tal vez el problema no es el candidato, sino su proceso de selección.Si ya entrevistaron a alguien y no lo seleccionaron, tengan la decencia de darle un cierre honesto en lugar de ignorarlo.No jueguen con el tiempo ni las esperanzas de las personas.📢 Candidatos, ¿les ha pasado? ¿Qué es lo más absurdo que les han dicho en un proceso de selección?Reclutadores, si creen que estoy equivocado, los leo en los comentarios. 👇hashtag#Reclutamiento hashtag#Hiring hashtag#RRHH hashtag#Respeto hashtag#Trabajo hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Candidatos hashtag#Transparencia hashtag#JusticiaLaboral hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#HiringProcess hashtag#TalentHunting hashtag#HRInsights hashtag#Headhunting hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#RecruitingFail hashtag#TrabajoDigno hashtag#JusticiaSalarial hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#TrabajoRemoto hashtag#JobSeekers hashtag#Employment hashtag#CareerOpportunities hashtag#CandidateExperience hashtag#NoMásGhosting hashtag#FeedbackLaboral hashtag#RespetoLaboral hashtag#HiringTransparency

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai

Rafael BrownRafael Brown,,"The Castle of Secrets  Steam page by Serene Questworks matches what the voice actors are saying. Why would the developer admit to using Gen AI Slop for voice acting? To not get removed from Steam.Steam's policy is that if you don't close AI usage and they find out, they remove your game and delist you from Steam. That's a big enough threat that developers are disclosing AI use. For indie game studios looking to cut corners, screwing voice actors is a terrible way to develop.This continues to show the extent of Gen AI in game dev. Gen AI is used for customer support, automated QA, placeholder VO, placeholder 2D art, placeholder localization, placeholder text. Only the truly incompetent and scammers use Gen AI for anything final.-----Castle of Secrets: AI GENERATED CONTENT DISCLOSURE""The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:Sometimes generated voice acting""Steam: https://lnkd.in/geHetV2c-----GameDeveloper: ""Indie dev Serene Questworks accused of replacing game's cast with AI voices. Generative AI is becoming more prevalent in games, and not every developer is completely honest about their intentions with it."" (Justin Carter) (March 11, 2025)Castle of Secrets developer Serene Questworks has been accused of hiring human voice actors, only to fire them and replace them with performances made with generative AI. Voice actor Mika Nerida claimed the studio ""decided they wanted to use AI-trained voices"" for its debut game, and ""canned every voice actor they had, refusing other talent onboard.""A picture in the post from Castle's voice director Ian Mitchell shows he was also banned from Castle's Steam hub by a Serene Questworks developer for ""personal hostility and imposing their position."" The now-deleted post on the game's forums claimed the studio ""used AI to make voice actors sound like multiple different people, instead of having the actors act out as the characters. Make it less authentic, as a computer's doing the voices.""Nerida told Game Developer she was initially cast under the belief she was meant to replace the game's initial AI placeholder voices. She later alleged Serene ""doubled back"" and implied AI would be used in some capacity. Both she and Mitchell refused this, after which they and the game's other human actors were ""kicked off"" the project.Per Mitchell, the actors were fired before voice recording was set to begin. He said the generated voices are more than a simple ""voice filter,"" and they ""make you sound like a different person completely. This was to save on costs of different voice actors, even though the voice actors who auditioned could do a MASSIVE range of voices for them.""""We asked to just let us voice act, instead of letting the computer do it for us,"" he continued.""GameDeveloper: https://lnkd.in/gxCpGP37hashtag#gameindustry hashtag#voiceacting hashtag#ai hashtag#aislop hashtag#aivoice hashtag#fakeai hashtag#genai hashtag#degenai
