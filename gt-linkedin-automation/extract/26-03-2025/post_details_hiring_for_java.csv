Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

Aadityasinh JadejaAadityasinh Jadeja,,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 💡One phone call changed my entire USA and job hunt journey.When I landed in the USA, I thought I knew the drill. Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝. 𝐼 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑𝑛’𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑒𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟.”𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱. (I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks.

Aadityasinh JadejaAadityasinh Jadeja,,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 💡One phone call changed my entire USA and job hunt journey.When I landed in the USA, I thought I knew the drill. Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝. 𝐼 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑𝑛’𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑒𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟.”𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱. (I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Aadityasinh JadejaAadityasinh Jadeja,,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 💡One phone call changed my entire USA and job hunt journey.When I landed in the USA, I thought I knew the drill. Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝. 𝐼 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑𝑛’𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑒𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟.”𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱. (I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality.

They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

Aadityasinh JadejaAadityasinh Jadeja,,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 💡One phone call changed my entire USA and job hunt journey.When I landed in the USA, I thought I knew the drill. Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝. 𝐼 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑𝑛’𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑒𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟.”𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱. (I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality.

They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality.

They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality.

They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality.

They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

Aadityasinh JadejaAadityasinh Jadeja,,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 💡One phone call changed my entire USA and job hunt journey.When I landed in the USA, I thought I knew the drill. Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝. 𝐼 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑𝑛’𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑒𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟.”𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱. (I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

In Episode 1, we talked about the frustrating cycle of needing experience to get a job. But let’s be real—lack of experience isn’t the only thing holding fresh graduates back.So, what are they actually missing? 🤔🚧 The Real-World Gaps & How to Tackle Them📌 Professional Communication – Texting your professor is different from emailing a recruiter. Tip: Learn formal email etiquette and practice clear, concise communication.📌 Problem-Solving Skills – Employers love candidates who can think on their feet. Tip: Challenge yourself with case studies, freelancing gigs, or even helping small businesses for free!📌 Networking Know-How – Most jobs are landed through connections, not just applications. Tip: Attend industry events, engage on LinkedIn (not just scroll), and reach out to professionals for guidance.📌 Adaptability & Workplace Etiquette – Office culture isn’t taught in textbooks. Tip: Follow industry leaders, watch workplace etiquette videos, and observe how professionals carry themselves.📌 Confidence & hashtag#PersonalBranding – If you don’t sell yourself, who will? Tip: Showcase projects, internships, or skills on a personal blog, LinkedIn, or portfolio. Employers love self-starters!So, fresh grads—are you truly ready for the job market, or just waiting for an opportunity? And hashtag#recruiters—are you willing to invest in potential rather than just experience?Stay tuned for Episode 3—where we talk about why fresh grads might just be the best hires you can make! 🎬hashtag#TheExperienceParadox hashtag#HireFreshTalent hashtag#VoiceOfHR

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝. 𝐼 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑𝑛’𝑡 ℎ𝑖𝑟𝑒 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑦 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑒𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟.”𝗧𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱. (I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

Nabeeda RaufNabeeda Rauf,,"🎬 Episode 2: What Fresh Graduates Are Missing???(Hint: It’s NOT just experience and a degree!)Welcome back to ""The Great hashtag#JobHunt"" series! In Episode 1, we talked about the frustrating cycle of needing experience to get a job. But let’s be real—lack of experience isn’t the only thing holding fresh graduates back.So, what are they actually missing? 🤔🚧 The Real-World Gaps & How to Tackle Them📌 Professional Communication – Texting your professor is different from emailing a recruiter. Tip: Learn formal email etiquette and practice clear, concise communication.📌 Problem-Solving Skills – Employers love candidates who can think on their feet. Tip: Challenge yourself with case studies, freelancing gigs, or even helping small businesses for free!📌 Networking Know-How – Most jobs are landed through connections, not just applications. Tip: Attend industry events, engage on LinkedIn (not just scroll), and reach out to professionals for guidance.📌 Adaptability & Workplace Etiquette – Office culture isn’t taught in textbooks. Tip: Follow industry leaders, watch workplace etiquette videos, and observe how professionals carry themselves.📌 Confidence & hashtag#PersonalBranding – If you don’t sell yourself, who will? Tip: Showcase projects, internships, or skills on a personal blog, LinkedIn, or portfolio. Employers love self-starters!So, fresh grads—are you truly ready for the job market, or just waiting for an opportunity? And hashtag#recruiters—are you willing to invest in potential rather than just experience?Stay tuned for Episode 3—where we talk about why fresh grads might just be the best hires you can make! 🎬hashtag#TheExperienceParadox hashtag#HireFreshTalent hashtag#VoiceOfHR

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

In Episode 1, we talked about the frustrating cycle of needing experience to get a job. But let’s be real—lack of experience isn’t the only thing holding fresh graduates back.So, what are they actually missing? 🤔🚧 The Real-World Gaps & How to Tackle Them📌 Professional Communication – Texting your professor is different from emailing a recruiter. Tip: Learn formal email etiquette and practice clear, concise communication.📌 Problem-Solving Skills – Employers love candidates who can think on their feet. Tip: Challenge yourself with case studies, freelancing gigs, or even helping small businesses for free!📌 Networking Know-How – Most jobs are landed through connections, not just applications. Tip: Attend industry events, engage on LinkedIn (not just scroll), and reach out to professionals for guidance.📌 Adaptability & Workplace Etiquette – Office culture isn’t taught in textbooks. Tip: Follow industry leaders, watch workplace etiquette videos, and observe how professionals carry themselves.📌 Confidence & hashtag#PersonalBranding – If you don’t sell yourself, who will? Tip: Showcase projects, internships, or skills on a personal blog, LinkedIn, or portfolio. Employers love self-starters!So, fresh grads—are you truly ready for the job market, or just waiting for an opportunity? And hashtag#recruiters—are you willing to invest in potential rather than just experience?Stay tuned for Episode 3—where we talk about why fresh grads might just be the best hires you can make! 🎬hashtag#TheExperienceParadox hashtag#HireFreshTalent hashtag#VoiceOfHR

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

In Episode 1, we talked about the frustrating cycle of needing experience to get a job. But let’s be real—lack of experience isn’t the only thing holding fresh graduates back.So, what are they actually missing? 🤔🚧 The Real-World Gaps & How to Tackle Them📌 Professional Communication – Texting your professor is different from emailing a recruiter. Tip: Learn formal email etiquette and practice clear, concise communication.📌 Problem-Solving Skills – Employers love candidates who can think on their feet. Tip: Challenge yourself with case studies, freelancing gigs, or even helping small businesses for free!📌 Networking Know-How – Most jobs are landed through connections, not just applications. Tip: Attend industry events, engage on LinkedIn (not just scroll), and reach out to professionals for guidance.📌 Adaptability & Workplace Etiquette – Office culture isn’t taught in textbooks. Tip: Follow industry leaders, watch workplace etiquette videos, and observe how professionals carry themselves.📌 Confidence & hashtag#PersonalBranding – If you don’t sell yourself, who will? Tip: Showcase projects, internships, or skills on a personal blog, LinkedIn, or portfolio. Employers love self-starters!So, fresh grads—are you truly ready for the job market, or just waiting for an opportunity? And hashtag#recruiters—are you willing to invest in potential rather than just experience?Stay tuned for Episode 3—where we talk about why fresh grads might just be the best hires you can make! 🎬hashtag#TheExperienceParadox hashtag#HireFreshTalent hashtag#VoiceOfHR

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

Nabeeda RaufNabeeda Rauf,,"🎬 Episode 2: What Fresh Graduates Are Missing???(Hint: It’s NOT just experience and a degree!)Welcome back to ""The Great hashtag#JobHunt"" series! In Episode 1, we talked about the frustrating cycle of needing experience to get a job. But let’s be real—lack of experience isn’t the only thing holding fresh graduates back.So, what are they actually missing? 🤔🚧 The Real-World Gaps & How to Tackle Them📌 Professional Communication – Texting your professor is different from emailing a recruiter. Tip: Learn formal email etiquette and practice clear, concise communication.📌 Problem-Solving Skills – Employers love candidates who can think on their feet. Tip: Challenge yourself with case studies, freelancing gigs, or even helping small businesses for free!📌 Networking Know-How – Most jobs are landed through connections, not just applications. Tip: Attend industry events, engage on LinkedIn (not just scroll), and reach out to professionals for guidance.📌 Adaptability & Workplace Etiquette – Office culture isn’t taught in textbooks. Tip: Follow industry leaders, watch workplace etiquette videos, and observe how professionals carry themselves.📌 Confidence & hashtag#PersonalBranding – If you don’t sell yourself, who will? Tip: Showcase projects, internships, or skills on a personal blog, LinkedIn, or portfolio. Employers love self-starters!So, fresh grads—are you truly ready for the job market, or just waiting for an opportunity? And hashtag#recruiters—are you willing to invest in potential rather than just experience?Stay tuned for Episode 3—where we talk about why fresh grads might just be the best hires you can make! 🎬hashtag#TheExperienceParadox hashtag#HireFreshTalent hashtag#VoiceOfHR

They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

In Episode 1, we talked about the frustrating cycle of needing experience to get a job. But let’s be real—lack of experience isn’t the only thing holding fresh graduates back.So, what are they actually missing? 🤔🚧 The Real-World Gaps & How to Tackle Them📌 Professional Communication – Texting your professor is different from emailing a recruiter. Tip: Learn formal email etiquette and practice clear, concise communication.📌 Problem-Solving Skills – Employers love candidates who can think on their feet. Tip: Challenge yourself with case studies, freelancing gigs, or even helping small businesses for free!📌 Networking Know-How – Most jobs are landed through connections, not just applications. Tip: Attend industry events, engage on LinkedIn (not just scroll), and reach out to professionals for guidance.📌 Adaptability & Workplace Etiquette – Office culture isn’t taught in textbooks. Tip: Follow industry leaders, watch workplace etiquette videos, and observe how professionals carry themselves.📌 Confidence & hashtag#PersonalBranding – If you don’t sell yourself, who will? Tip: Showcase projects, internships, or skills on a personal blog, LinkedIn, or portfolio. Employers love self-starters!So, fresh grads—are you truly ready for the job market, or just waiting for an opportunity? And hashtag#recruiters—are you willing to invest in potential rather than just experience?Stay tuned for Episode 3—where we talk about why fresh grads might just be the best hires you can make! 🎬hashtag#TheExperienceParadox hashtag#HireFreshTalent hashtag#VoiceOfHR

Every YouTube video, podcast, senior, and influencer said the same thing - Start applying the day you land. Network like your life depends on it.- But guess what? For the first month, I did nothing.- I thought I had time. What I didn’t realize was that the race had already begun. People around me had started months ago.Then I got a call from Pritesh Jagani aka Yudi.- He’s been my mentor for a long time, and that day, he brought me back to reality. His words?“𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑘 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 10-15 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠 𝑎 𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑘 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ? 𝑌𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑡 𝑑𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑛𝑦𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔.”I showed him my resume, thinking it was decent. His response?“𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑝.

(I told him to be critical, he is actually very sweet)𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀- Not everyone gets the privilege of having someone like Pritesh in their corner. - Mentors aren’t just guides, they’re your reality checks. They: Call you out when you’re slacking. Appreciate your wins. Show you the path when you’re lost. Motivate you when you feel like giving up.- I’m incredibly grateful to have mentors like:Tejaswini -  Always giving me honest advice when I need it most.Rufeda - Her interview tips helped me tackle some of my toughest interviews.Maya - Every like, comment, or reaction of her gave me latest update from recruiters, and hiring managers.Some may not even know they’re my mentors, but they’ve played a huge role in my journey. And I’m not afraid to reach out when I need guidance.𝗜𝗳 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗼𝗻’𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗲𝘁, 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼:- Look up to people who are already in your dream role or company.- Reach out. Don’t hesitate to ask for their advice.- Stay open to feedback. Sometimes, the toughest words will lead to the greatest growth.Mentors can change your perspective, your career, and even your life.If you’re still waiting for a sign to find one, this is it.

However, my focus is on gaining experience and contributing to a team, rather than sponsorship. With authorization to work in the U.S. for up to three years under OPT, I am eager to grow as a developer.I appreciate referrals, networking opportunities, and any leads that could help me secure the right opportunity. Feel free to explore my portfolio at https://lnkd.in/gDUt6-Am and share it with potential employers.If you or someone in your network is aware of openings that match my skills, I am keen to connect.

Luis MartinezLuis Martinez,,"MORE recruiters 🟰  MORE opportunities ❓ Not in Public Practice 👇 I've been working with a candidate who is working with multiple recruiters and sending direct applications to firms at the same time. On paper, it sounds like a smart move: more applications = more opportunities, right? 🤓 Not quite.Instead of increasing their chances, it created confusion. Some firms received their application twice—once from me and once directly. Others got it from multiple recruiters. 😟 HR teams were left untangling the mess, causing delays and raising questions about the candidate’s approach. Worst of all, it gave off a sense of desperation. 🤦‍♂️ Here’s the reality: One good recruiter who knows your industry, understands your value, and has strong client relationships is far more effective than a scattergun approach. A specialist recruiter ensures your application is handled professionally, placed in front of the right people, and positioned for success—without the chaos.More applications don’t guarantee more offers. The right strategy does. 👍 What do you think? Have you seen this happen before?

Nippon Consulting株式会社Nippon Consulting株式会社,,"Don’t Let Top Talent Slip Away: The Importance of Speed in RecruitmentIn today’s competitive job market, attracting top talent requires more than just offering a great salary package. Sometimes, an experienced candidate may choose to accept a lower salary than their current one, not because they are dissatisfied with their current position, nor because they've received a downsizing notice, but for personal reasons that align with their career goals or life circumstances.I recently came across a situation where a highly experienced candidate, with an impressive track record, decided to accept a lower salary to join a new company. However, after this decision, the potential employer chose to slow down the recruitment process.To the employer: I understand the desire to take a step back and evaluate the candidate carefully, but in the fast-paced world of recruitment, especially in countries like Japan where top-quality talent is scarce, speed is key. Candidates like this are often in high demand, and delays can result in losing out on exceptional talent.Don’t let hesitation cost you the chance to bring in someone who could make a significant impact. Keep the process moving forward and ensure you are responsive. In a competitive market, recruiting the best requires agility, decisiveness, and timely action.Hiring decisions should never be rushed, but don't let the opportunity slip away because of unnecessary delays.hashtag#Recruitment hashtag#TalentAcquisition hashtag#Hiring hashtag#Leadership hashtag#JapanJobMarket hashtag#SpeedMatters

In Episode 1, we talked about the frustrating cycle of needing experience to get a job. But let’s be real—lack of experience isn’t the only thing holding fresh graduates back.So, what are they actually missing? 🤔🚧 The Real-World Gaps & How to Tackle Them📌 Professional Communication – Texting your professor is different from emailing a recruiter. Tip: Learn formal email etiquette and practice clear, concise communication.📌 Problem-Solving Skills – Employers love candidates who can think on their feet. Tip: Challenge yourself with case studies, freelancing gigs, or even helping small businesses for free!📌 Networking Know-How – Most jobs are landed through connections, not just applications. Tip: Attend industry events, engage on LinkedIn (not just scroll), and reach out to professionals for guidance.📌 Adaptability & Workplace Etiquette – Office culture isn’t taught in textbooks. Tip: Follow industry leaders, watch workplace etiquette videos, and observe how professionals carry themselves.📌 Confidence & hashtag#PersonalBranding – If you don’t sell yourself, who will? Tip: Showcase projects, internships, or skills on a personal blog, LinkedIn, or portfolio. Employers love self-starters!So, fresh grads—are you truly ready for the job market, or just waiting for an opportunity? And hashtag#recruiters—are you willing to invest in potential rather than just experience?Stay tuned for Episode 3—where we talk about why fresh grads might just be the best hires you can make! 🎬hashtag#TheExperienceParadox hashtag#HireFreshTalent hashtag#VoiceOfHR
