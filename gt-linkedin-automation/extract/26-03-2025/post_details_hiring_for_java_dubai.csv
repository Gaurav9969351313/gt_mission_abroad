Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan.

mohamed fahmymohamed fahmy,,"""The Dubai Real Estate Paradox: Why Aren’t You Selling More?I’m amazed when real estate companies in Dubai invest millions but still struggle to close deals.Here’s the truth: Dubai sells itself—just like an iPhone. People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here. The question is: Are you ready to rethink your strategy?""hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateMarketing hashtag#InvestInDubai

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

mohamed fahmymohamed fahmy,,"""The Dubai Real Estate Paradox: Why Aren’t You Selling More?I’m amazed when real estate companies in Dubai invest millions but still struggle to close deals.Here’s the truth: Dubai sells itself—just like an iPhone. People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here. The question is: Are you ready to rethink your strategy?""hashtag#DubaiRealEstate hashtag#RealEstateMarketing hashtag#InvestInDubai

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

mohamed fahmymohamed fahmy,,"""The Dubai Real Estate Paradox: Why Aren’t You Selling More?I’m amazed when real estate companies in Dubai invest millions but still struggle to close deals.Here’s the truth: Dubai sells itself—just like an iPhone. People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

Zakeer HassenZakeer Hassen,,"Calling out all the job seekers in UAE! Recruitment Scam!!!Hi this is Zakeer! Let me be the voice for all the job seekers who are facing recruitment fraudulents; recently i am hunting job opportunities in UAE; Yesterday (24/03/2025) I received an email for interview (email attached), so i was so happy that i am going to perform well, here i am going to share what happened exactly,With the total money of 540 AED as a job seeker who is hustling the hiring politics in organizations. I reached Abu Hail metro station and went to city bay center for the interview at office no 105 and there was an empty hall with some chairs with 3 partitioned offices with a marketing room where all these drama carries out. The interviewer was a Filipina lady selected me as a Data Entry Specialist to work with her with the monthly salary of AED 7,500.00 and she requested to process my visa I have to pay 525 AED in advance, I gave her that as a cash suddenly after paying I had a bad feeling and called my best buddy Mohamed Roshan for an advise, he researched about the company and exposed to me that these recruiters are scammers who loot the money targeting the job seekers.So, immediately I went back to the HR and requested for my refund but I got to see true colors of the firm that I am recruited (payment receipt voucher attached) and i called the DubaiPolice dialing 999 they don't give me a proper response. I understood here that i got tackled with their marketing tricks and signed the brochure which is mentioned as “there is no refund on the same day and it will take 20 days after the 7 days of signing the refund form” Here I am advising to all the job seekers please take care while applying for jobs. Always look for proper email signature, request the recruiters too about the company research it in the web, if any payment requires please avoid it.Office Details and location:Company Name: ADVANCE LEVEL HUMAN RESOURCES CONSULTANT SERVICES Location: City Bay Centre, 1st Floor, Office No. 105, near Abu Hail Metro Station, Exit 2, DubaiLocation Map: https://lnkd.in/gWYGN83pNote: Imagine a person struggling without a job and has no one in Dubai what might will be his/her situation? Why doesn’t hashtag#united_arab_emirates has a law to scare the fake recruitment centers as on the spot action by the government of emirates, and so far what i know it is allowed to attend interviews under visit visa but not to work unless you hold a employment visa.Please repost for awareness and looking for advise and justice 💔hashtag#fightforyourrights hashtag#unitedarabemirates hashtag#open_to_work Dubai Police HQ DUBAI COURTSDr. Hassan ElhaisMinistry of Human Resources and Emiratisation Dubailaws Net Dubai Global News HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum The Government of Dubai Legal Affairs Department محامي في دبي Best Lawyer in Dubai‎

People  walk into an Apple Store because of the salesman; they come for the brand, trust, and unmatched value.So why aren’t you leveraging that?✅ Your agents aren’t just ‘salespeople’—they should be trusted advisors.✅ Stop selling ‘properties’. Sell Dubai’s lifestyle, safety, and ROI.✅ If you’re competing on price, you’re doing it wrong. Dubai isn’t a ‘cheap’ market—it’s a premium one.The opportunity is here.

Arif K.Arif K.,,"Sharing A sad story of investor in Dubaihad worst experience with hashtag#Burjumanmall Al Ghurair Al Ghurair Group management were change right after three months as we leased a shop in BurJuman Mall @al Dubai . unfortunately the new leasing director Vythnathan M. kept pushing us right after joining that we have to relocate or vacate the shop but all verbally and when I sent email to make it confirm he responded officially after a year and sent an letter with courier to vacate the shop within 15days.because this area falls under new development plan. Imagine three months only we completed in the mall as a new tanent and we invest a lot of money. Anyhow we managed to cover almost 18 months while he didn’t offer any feasible location as replacement.I asked three location he refused but those three given to other brands and option which he offered to others now and the one for what we had convinced him a lot, he offered to other brand one in right half rent what he told us and given excuse that this is prime location and we wanted only a well known brand. while it’s the first shop same as us. We signed lease June 2021, vacated on January 2023 and till now that place is empty and new development is not making any impact to that site far and far 😃.The purpose of story is that we lost almost AED 20-25k per month+ investment and time and Imagine December 2022  was the first month we observe business in profit and We were kicked out after rounding all ariund but found helpless. Even The CEO of BurJuman Mall Mr. Ghaith Shocair ignored my several email request for meeting in person. Include with his Secretary.Because CEO himself was the mastermind of Mall’s new development plan. And he offered premium locations to other two brands on same floor while he was pushing us to go on the third floor.Finally with all frustration we quickly shut the shop and lost almost million in one and half year with not even single rent cheque bounced and no compensation from mall management.  Due to loan/financial debt had to sold house in India recently to at least survive and lost health too. Today is the day, struggling for daily bread and butter caused of such huge financial loss. Had invested all life’s earned money with a feasible plan to expand business with new investors etc but wasn’t aware about hashtag#Corrupt people in UAE.Its Fifthhashtag#RamadanKareem in UAE with no new cloths on hashtag#eidulfitr But it’s okay because already health is now on survival condition with no insurance, due medical bill etc.

Mahmood AbdullaMahmood Abdulla,,"The UAE has officially been ranked the 2nd safest country in the world in 2025 by Numbeo This isn’t just an impressive statistic it’s a reflection of a long term national strategy that places human security at the heart of development and transformation. According to the Global Safety Index by Numbeo, the UAE stands proudly at the top surpassing global giants like Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Only Andorra precedes us, but the UAE continues to lead the region and inspire the world.But how did the UAE reach this milestone?Let’s break it down:1. Visionary Leadership with a Clear PurposeFrom the very beginning, the UAE’s leadership — guided by the principles of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan our founding father and carried forward by HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has believed that safety is the foundation of progress.A safe country attracts investment, encourages tourism, retains talent, and builds social trust all essential elements in a sustainable economy.2. Strategic Investment in Infrastructure and Law EnforcementThe UAE continuously invests in cutting-edge surveillance technologies, smart policing, and emergency response systems.Dubai and Abu Dhabi are recognized for having CCTV coverage that rivals top-tier global cities, while law enforcement agencies are trained to operate with both efficiency and empathy.3. A Social Contract Built on CoexistenceHosting over 200 nationalities, the UAE created a society based on mutual respect, cultural tolerance, and social harmony.Efforts such as the Ministry of Tolerance, interfaith dialogues, and inclusive national policies have fostered a climate where people feel safe regardless of background.4. Robust Legislative and Judicial SystemsThe UAE’s legal system prioritizes security through zero tolerance for crime, swift judicial processes, and strong penalties for violations creating a strong deterrent.But justice is also paired with fairness, ensuring that citizens and residents trust the system.5. Safe Cities as Economic EnablersCities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai consistently rank among the safest in the world, enabling them to become magnets for talent, capital, and innovation.This environment has helped the UAE become a global hub for tourism, business, and entrepreneurship.Leadership Insight:HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid once said:“Security and safety are not optional. They are the foundation of every civilization and the prerequisite for any development.”This achievement is not accidental it’s intentional. It reflects a nation where leadership, policy and society are aligned under a single vision to be among the best in the world and the safest.In a time when the world seeks stability, the United Arab Emirates offers certainty. Safety here isn’t just measured by crime rates. It’s measured by peace of mind, confidence in the future, and belief in leadership.

Let me be the voice for all the job seekers who are facing recruitment fraudulents; recently i am hunting job opportunities in UAE; Yesterday (24/03/2025) I received an email for interview (email attached), so i was so happy that i am going to perform well, here i am going to share what happened exactly,With the total money of 540 AED as a job seeker who is hustling the hiring politics in organizations. I reached Abu Hail metro station and went to city bay center for the interview at office no 105 and there was an empty hall with some chairs with 3 partitioned offices with a marketing room where all these drama carries out. The interviewer was a Filipina lady selected me as a Data Entry Specialist to work with her with the monthly salary of AED 7,500.00 and she requested to process my visa I have to pay 525 AED in advance, I gave her that as a cash suddenly after paying I had a bad feeling and called my best buddy Mohamed Roshan for an advise, he researched about the company and exposed to me that these recruiters are scammers who loot the money targeting the job seekers.So, immediately I went back to the HR and requested for my refund but I got to see true colors of the firm that I am recruited (payment receipt voucher attached) and i called the DubaiPolice dialing 999 they don't give me a proper response. I understood here that i got tackled with their marketing tricks and signed the brochure which is mentioned as “there is no refund on the same day and it will take 20 days after the 7 days of signing the refund form” Here I am advising to all the job seekers please take care while applying for jobs. Always look for proper email signature, request the recruiters too about the company research it in the web, if any payment requires please avoid it.Office Details and location:Company Name: ADVANCE LEVEL HUMAN RESOURCES CONSULTANT SERVICES Location: City Bay Centre, 1st Floor, Office No. 105, near Abu Hail Metro Station, Exit 2, DubaiLocation Map: https://lnkd.in/gWYGN83pNote: Imagine a person struggling without a job and has no one in Dubai what might will be his/her situation?
