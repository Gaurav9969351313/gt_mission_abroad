Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Previously, candidates could receive 50 or 200 extra points for a valid job offer, significantly boosting their chances of receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence. This change affects all candidates in the Express Entry pool who had these additional points. However, those who have already received ITAs or have applications in progress are not impacted.

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Ella MorganElla Morgan,,"🚀 What Makes a Great Contractor? 🚀It’s great to see the day rate contract market picking up after a slower 18 months! But while demand is on the rise, contract roles remain highly competitive.As recruiters, we can often tell instantly when we come across a standout contractor—those professionals who not only secure roles quickly but also get extended or rebooked time and time again. So, what sets them apart?💡 Here’s what makes a great contractor stand out from a good one:✅ Adaptability & Speed – The best contractors can hit the ground running. They quickly grasp new environments, tools, and processes, making an immediate impact rather than needing lengthy onboarding.✅ Clear, Outcome-Focused Communication – Whether you're a BA running workshops or a QA reporting defects, clear communication is key. Contractors who can articulate problems, solutions, and outcomes concisely make life easier for teams and stakeholders.✅ Proven Expertise & Specialisation – While generalists have their place, the most in-demand contractors own their niche. Whether it’s API testing, regulatory change, data migration, or system integrations, those with clear specialisation stand out.✅ A Strong Contracting Mindset – Contracting is different from permanent roles. The best contractors own their deliverables, manage their time well, and require minimal hand-holding. They understand their role is to solve a problem, not just fill a seat.✅ Proactive Problem-Solving – No one wants a contractor who just highlights issues—they want someone who brings solutions. Whether it’s identifying process improvements or flagging risks early, the best contractors think ahead.✅ Contract Extensions & Repeat Hirers – While contracts sometimes get cut short for reasons outside your control, a track record of extensions or repeat work with the same clients speaks volumes. A history of 9-month+ contracts shows that you’re not just a short-term fix—you’re someone companies value and that you value your commitment to them!✅ An Updated & Targeted CV – Time is everything in contract recruitment. A great contractor has a sharp, up-to-date CV that clearly outlines their latest projects, tech stack, and achievements, making it easy for hiring managers to see their value instantly (generally in 5 pages or less!!)✅ Strong Professional Networks – Many contracts get filled before they even hit the market. Contractors who stay engaged with their recruiters, industry contacts, and past clients are often first in line for new opportunities.🚀 Levelling Up Your Contracting Game? 🚀 If you’re looking to secure your next BA or QA contract, focusing on these areas can make all the difference. And if you’re on the hunt for your next gig—let’s connect!What do you think makes a standout contractor? I know there may be some different opinions out there, would love to hear your thoughts in the comments! 👇hashtag#BusinessAnalysis hashtag#QualityAssurance hashtag#ContractRecruitment hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch

Harjot Singh PanesarHarjot Singh Panesar,,"🚨 Automation Engineers Are Not Testers—And That’s a Problem 🚨I see it all the time: teams hiring “QA Automation Engineers” who don’t actually test anything. They write code. They build frameworks. They automate whatever test cases they’re handed.But here’s the problem—automation without real testing skills is just code that gives you a false sense of security.I’ve worked with engineers who could build a perfect framework from scratch but had no clue how to design a meaningful test. Worse, they didn’t even question the test cases they were automating. They just blindly followed whatever was written, without improving or expanding them.And the result?❌ A bloated test suite that’s expensive to maintain but adds little value.❌ Missed edge cases because “it wasn’t in the test case.”❌ Tests that pass even when something is obviously broken—because they weren’t designed to truly validate behavior.Good automation starts with good testing. That means:✅ Knowing what’s worth automating (and what isn’t).✅ Thinking like a tester first, not just a developer writing code.✅ Reviewing and improving test cases, not just following them blindly.If we forget the testing mindset, we’re just writing code that go through the motions without proving anything meaningful.So let me ask—are you automating tests, or just automating steps? Let’s debate. 👇
