Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing. They might know what they want but don’t have the internal talent to execute it.Thus, they face a big decision regarding AI: should they build AI talent from within their team, hire experts, or leverage no-code platforms? Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Here are some key roles to consider.

Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing. They might know what they want but don’t have the internal talent to execute it.Thus, they face a big decision regarding AI: should they build AI talent from within their team, hire experts, or leverage no-code platforms? Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly? Hiring external experts or working with consultants gives you fast results. But be prepared to invest in upskilling your internal team for the future.3. Leverage No-code AI: empower everyone, fastNo-code platforms let you automate processes without coding for quick AI prototypes or small-scale projects. Perfect for businesses with limited resources.4. The Winning Combo: A Strategic Mix for AI MasteryCombine all three: Use no-code platforms for prototyping, hire experts for complex tasks, and upskill your internal team for the long haul.Whether you choose to build, buy, use no-code platforms, or blend all three, the key is aligning your AI talent strategy with your company’s needs. Here are some key roles to consider. You will need a combination of these roles for your specific projects.-Data Scientists-Data Engineers-Machine Learning Engineers-AI Architects-DevOps Engineers (for AI)-AI Project Managers-Business Analysts-Product Managers-Cloud EngineersWhether internally or externally, the right combination of these roles will ensure your AI project thrives.What’s your strategy?

Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing.

Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing. They might know what they want but don’t have the internal talent to execute it.Thus, they face a big decision regarding AI: should they build AI talent from within their team, hire experts, or leverage no-code platforms? Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Here are some key roles to consider.

Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing.

Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing. They might know what they want but don’t have the internal talent to execute it.Thus, they face a big decision regarding AI: should they build AI talent from within their team, hire experts, or leverage no-code platforms? Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Here are some key roles to consider.

Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing.

Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing. They might know what they want but don’t have the internal talent to execute it.Thus, they face a big decision regarding AI: should they build AI talent from within their team, hire experts, or leverage no-code platforms? Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Here are some key roles to consider.

Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing.

Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing. They might know what they want but don’t have the internal talent to execute it.Thus, they face a big decision regarding AI: should they build AI talent from within their team, hire experts, or leverage no-code platforms? Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?

Here are some key roles to consider.

Eric M. SeukepEric M. Seukep,,"To buy or not to buy AI talent?Many companies experienced frustration when trying to bring their AI vision to life.They plan to build a dream house but don’t know how to lay bricks or install plumbing.

Here’s a quick way to approach it:1. Build AI Talent: Invest for Long-Term DominationIf you’re committed to AI for the long run, investing in internal talent is the way to go. It takes time, but upskilling your team creates long-term value and fosters a culture of innovation.2. Buy AI Talent: Ignite Growth NowNeed AI expertise quickly?
