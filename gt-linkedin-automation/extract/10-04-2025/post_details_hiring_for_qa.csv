Kostiantyn ZinevychKostiantyn Zinevych,,"🚀 If I Were Starting a Startup Again — Here’s What I’d Do Differently7 years building in a tough niche (logistics).Still standing. Still learning.No perfect exits. No hockey stick.But we’re alive — and growing.And if I could talk to my past self…Here’s what I’d say — brutally honestly.---------------------------------------------------🧭 Don’t start with code or a deckStart with pain.Real pain.Then — Excel:✅ What would it cost?✅ Who would pay?✅ How soon would it return?Then: a short brief and client validation.Start with revenue logic. Not features.---------------------------------------------------🛠️ Tech ≠ ProductDev founders build.Buyers decide.At CarGoo (https://cargoo.ua/en) (https://cargoo.io/en), the best improvements were… boring:📄 a better form✍️ a simple comment field⚡ a bit of animationThe “cool stuff” we spent months on? Mostly ignored.Simple, fast, useful beats clever every time.---------------------------------------------------🏗️ No architecture = slow deathIf your product grows and the foundation is weak:💥 You’ll refactor mid-crisis💸 You’ll overpay on infrastructure🐌 You’ll hire more just to move slowerWhat you skip early will come back 10x louder.---------------------------------------------------👥 Hiring isn’t just a checklistTech founders forget soft skills.Non-tech founders don’t even know what to check.And hiring friends? 😬 Risky as hell.Look for ownership. Curiosity. Team fit.---------------------------------------------------🧪 QA is your unsung heroThey catch what breaks — before your users do.They don’t present on demos.But they’re the reason your product still works.No QA = no peace.---------------------------------------------------🎨 UX isn’t art — it’s tractionGood UX means fewer questions, better adoption, and actual love.Your designer can become the soul of your product — or your team’s biggest pain.Invest wisely.---------------------------------------------------🔥 Final thoughtSurround yourself with people who give a damn.Skills can grow.Character — not so much.And yeah — despite all of it, I’d still build.Because there’s nothing like seeing someone use what you created — and smile.💬 If you could send ONE message to your past startup self…What would it be?👇 Slide through — maybe you’ll recognize yourself in here.

Still learning.No perfect exits. No hockey stick.But we’re alive — and growing.And if I could talk to my past self…Here’s what I’d say — brutally honestly.---------------------------------------------------🧭 Don’t start with code or a deckStart with pain.Real pain.Then — Excel:✅ What would it cost?✅ Who would pay?✅ How soon would it return?Then: a short brief and client validation.Start with revenue logic. Not features.---------------------------------------------------🛠️ Tech ≠ ProductDev founders build.Buyers decide.At CarGoo (https://cargoo.ua/en) (https://cargoo.io/en), the best improvements were… boring:📄 a better form✍️ a simple comment field⚡ a bit of animationThe “cool stuff” we spent months on? Mostly ignored.Simple, fast, useful beats clever every time.---------------------------------------------------🏗️ No architecture = slow deathIf your product grows and the foundation is weak:💥 You’ll refactor mid-crisis💸 You’ll overpay on infrastructure🐌 You’ll hire more just to move slowerWhat you skip early will come back 10x louder.---------------------------------------------------👥 Hiring isn’t just a checklistTech founders forget soft skills.Non-tech founders don’t even know what to check.And hiring friends? 😬 Risky as hell.Look for ownership. Curiosity. Team fit.---------------------------------------------------🧪 QA is your unsung heroThey catch what breaks — before your users do.They don’t present on demos.But they’re the reason your product still works.No QA = no peace.---------------------------------------------------🎨 UX isn’t art — it’s tractionGood UX means fewer questions, better adoption, and actual love.Your designer can become the soul of your product — or your team’s biggest pain.Invest wisely.---------------------------------------------------🔥 Final thoughtSurround yourself with people who give a damn.Skills can grow.Character — not so much.And yeah — despite all of it, I’d still build.Because there’s nothing like seeing someone use what you created — and smile.💬 If you could send ONE message to your past startup self…What would it be?👇 Slide through — maybe you’ll recognize yourself in here.

No hockey stick.But we’re alive — and growing.And if I could talk to my past self…Here’s what I’d say — brutally honestly.---------------------------------------------------🧭 Don’t start with code or a deckStart with pain.Real pain.Then — Excel:✅ What would it cost?✅ Who would pay?✅ How soon would it return?Then: a short brief and client validation.Start with revenue logic. Not features.---------------------------------------------------🛠️ Tech ≠ ProductDev founders build.Buyers decide.At CarGoo (https://cargoo.ua/en) (https://cargoo.io/en), the best improvements were… boring:📄 a better form✍️ a simple comment field⚡ a bit of animationThe “cool stuff” we spent months on?
