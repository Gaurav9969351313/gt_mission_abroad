A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you.

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

"Jomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISCJomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISC",,"Beyond the Waves: Can We First Connect the Sand?A few days ago, I shared my thoughts on the iconic Dubai Metro launch and the still-unrealized dream of inter-emirate metro links. Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

"Jomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISCJomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISC",,"Beyond the Waves: Can We First Connect the Sand?A few days ago, I shared my thoughts on the iconic Dubai Metro launch and the still-unrealized dream of inter-emirate metro links. Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

"Jomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISCJomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISC",,"Beyond the Waves: Can We First Connect the Sand?A few days ago, I shared my thoughts on the iconic Dubai Metro launch and the still-unrealized dream of inter-emirate metro links. Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

"Jomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISCJomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISC",,"Beyond the Waves: Can We First Connect the Sand?A few days ago, I shared my thoughts on the iconic Dubai Metro launch and the still-unrealized dream of inter-emirate metro links. Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

"Jomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISCJomon Kuruvilla CA, CISA, FIII, CRISC",,"Beyond the Waves: Can We First Connect the Sand?A few days ago, I shared my thoughts on the iconic Dubai Metro launch and the still-unrealized dream of inter-emirate metro links. Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home.

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding.

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰

Now, headlines are lighting up with talk of a Dubai–Mumbai underwater train. Two thousand kilometers. Under the Arabian Sea. Ambitious? Undoubtedly. Exciting? Definitely.But here’s a question we should ask before diving that deep—can we first lay tracks across our own land?Thousands still commute daily between Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Abu Dhabi. Anyone who's sat through that morning gridlock knows this isn’t just a transportation issue—it’s a productivity issue, a sustainability issue, a quality of life issue.I’m not one to dismiss big dreams. After all, this is the UAE—a country where the word “impossible” often gets quietly deleted from the dictionary. But even the most revolutionary ideas must respect the first principles of physics, engineering, and economics.So maybe it’s time we channel some of that futuristic energy into something a little closer to home. High-speed, high-capacity metro links between our emirates. Efficient, eco-friendly, and entirely achievable with today’s tech.

Mitchell FranklinMitchell Franklin,,"If you’ve been waiting for a sign to level up and get on board something special, this might just be it. We’re adding a few key players to the team. All final interviews will take place in person in Dubai, London or New York. 🤝☕️1️⃣🐺 Contract – DubaiTeam up with Zach to help scale our UK/EU contract offering. A core foundation of our end goal, so we’re looking for the top 1% – someone who knows how to build, not just transact. Maybe you’re doing well, but realise it is best to move now before the golden handcuffs are put on. Or perhaps you're hashtag#solo and missing the team culture. Sick of the headaches of chasing invoices, and would rather spend more time doing what you do best.Whether you're focused on Software or Data, or can make a strong case to pivot into these markets, we want to hear from you. If you’ve got the mindset and the motivation this is the platform.2️⃣🦅 Software or Data – New York or DubaiThe US market is part of our DNA. You'll work directly with Nathan and myself who have combined generated over $6,000,000 in the hashtag#USA market. You’ll need to be based in NY, or willing to start in Dubai (yes, that means unsociable hours) with a plan to relocate to NYC.This market is more competitive than ever – if you’re not ready to hustle, it’ll eat you alive. If you’ve got the drive and know how to add value to internal teams and hiring managers, the rewards here are immense. Big BD energy required. Big ambition essential. This one isn’t for the faint-hearted… but the ceiling? Doesn’t exist.3️⃣🦀  Rust & JVM – DubaiJoin Jai and Husnan in one of our fastest-growing teams. Rust is becoming one of the most loved languages globally. After years of hype in blockchain and Web3, we’re now seeing commercial adoption across numerous industries – and it's only just beginning. Someone with experience in the JVM ecosystem or static/low-latency languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, hashtag#Rust, Golang or C++. If you’re ready to go deep in a market with long-term upside and big growth plans, this one’s for you.4️⃣🐍 Python – DubaiWork alongside Adam and Jack in a team that’s on the bleeding edge of tech. Python is powering the most innovative advancements in hashtag#Data, AI, and ML - and every day brings a new challenge. Someone who geeks out over where the tech world is heading and wants to be part of it. You’ll need some experience in this space, and at least a basic understanding of the ever-evolving world of AI (yes, it’s a minefield, and yes, you’ll need to become an expert in it). But if you’re curious and hungry, you’ll thrive here.💙 What you'll get at UMATR? An ambitious growing company where everyone’s in it together. A culture that’s fun, supportive, and rewarding. Autonomy and a real platform to grow your career with equity on offer for those who add significant value.Interested? DM me. Or share this with someone who needs to see this - I'll offer a dh10,000 referral to fill these key positions. 💰
