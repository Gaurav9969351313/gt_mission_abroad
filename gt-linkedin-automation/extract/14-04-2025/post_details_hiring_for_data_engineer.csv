Every single day.  ✅ Eliminate unforced errors. Why? Because there’s already a labor shortage in data center construction. Nobody has time to learn new tech. Data centers are getting bigger. The MEP is getting denser. The schedules are approaching impossible. MEP contractors don’t have extra technicians. GCs don’t have spare superintendents. Developers want to stay out of the way. That’s why we do the work for you. Our full-time field engineers bring the AR, run the workflows, and deliver productivity & real-time data to your project, every day.

The MEP is getting denser. The schedules are approaching impossible. MEP contractors don’t have extra technicians. GCs don’t have spare superintendents. Developers want to stay out of the way.

The MEP is getting denser. The schedules are approaching impossible. MEP contractors don’t have extra technicians. GCs don’t have spare superintendents. Developers want to stay out of the way.

Matt TormaMatt Torma,,"XYZ Reality is a fully managed service, not a product. We don’t sell augmented reality.We use it to: ✅ Layout & install MEP faster.  ✅ Track progress. In real-time. Every single day.  ✅ Eliminate unforced errors. Why? Because there’s already a labor shortage in data center construction. Nobody has time to learn new tech. Data centers are getting bigger. The MEP is getting denser. The schedules are approaching impossible. MEP contractors don’t have extra technicians. GCs don’t have spare superintendents. Developers want to stay out of the way. That’s why we do the work for you. Our full-time field engineers bring the AR, run the workflows, and deliver productivity & real-time data to your project, every day. If you're building data centers but your team is stretched thin, XYZ Reality can help you scale without hiring.

Matt TormaMatt Torma,,"XYZ Reality is a fully managed service, not a product. We don’t sell augmented reality.We use it to: ✅ Layout & install MEP faster.  ✅ Track progress. In real-time. Every single day.  ✅ Eliminate unforced errors. Why? Because there’s already a labor shortage in data center construction. Nobody has time to learn new tech. Data centers are getting bigger. The MEP is getting denser. The schedules are approaching impossible. MEP contractors don’t have extra technicians. GCs don’t have spare superintendents. Developers want to stay out of the way. That’s why we do the work for you. Our full-time field engineers bring the AR, run the workflows, and deliver productivity & real-time data to your project, every day. If you're building data centers but your team is stretched thin, XYZ Reality can help you scale without hiring.

Matt TormaMatt Torma,,"XYZ Reality is a fully managed service, not a product. We don’t sell augmented reality.We use it to: ✅ Layout & install MEP faster.  ✅ Track progress. In real-time. Every single day.  ✅ Eliminate unforced errors. Why? Because there’s already a labor shortage in data center construction. Nobody has time to learn new tech. Data centers are getting bigger. The MEP is getting denser. The schedules are approaching impossible. MEP contractors don’t have extra technicians. GCs don’t have spare superintendents. Developers want to stay out of the way. That’s why we do the work for you. Our full-time field engineers bring the AR, run the workflows, and deliver productivity & real-time data to your project, every day. If you're building data centers but your team is stretched thin, XYZ Reality can help you scale without hiring.

Priti RajPriti Raj,,"Azure Data: Powering Intelligent Business DecisionsIn the evolving landscape of cloud computing, data has become a vital asset for organizations aiming to innovate and stay competitive. Microsoft Azure, a leading cloud services provider, offers a comprehensive suite of data-related services under the umbrella of Azure Data. These services are designed to help businesses store, manage, and analyze data efficiently, enabling smarter and faster decision-making.Azure Data encompasses a wide range of solutions that cater to various data needs, from traditional relational databases to modern big data analytics. One of the most popular services is Azure SQL Database, a fully managed relational database that provides high performance, scalability, and advanced security features. It is ideal for applications that require structured data storage and real-time processing.For organizations dealing with massive volumes of unstructured data, Azure Data Lake offers a scalable and secure platform to store and process data of any size and type. This service is particularly useful for big data analytics, allowing data engineers and scientists to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.Another powerful component of Azure Data is Azure Synapse Analytics, an integrated analytics service that combines data warehousing and big data analytics. It allows businesses to query data using serverless or provisioned resources, making it easier to analyze data and generate reports across large datasets.In addition to these core services, Azure Data also includes tools for data integration, such as Azure Data Factory, and real-time analytics solutions like Azure Stream Analytics.

Every single day.  ✅ Eliminate unforced errors. Why? Because there’s already a labor shortage in data center construction. Nobody has time to learn new tech. Data centers are getting bigger. The MEP is getting denser. The schedules are approaching impossible. MEP contractors don’t have extra technicians. GCs don’t have spare superintendents. Developers want to stay out of the way. That’s why we do the work for you. Our full-time field engineers bring the AR, run the workflows, and deliver productivity & real-time data to your project, every day. If you're building data centers but your team is stretched thin, XYZ Reality can help you scale without hiring.
