Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct. So the question is...Do you have a productivity problem or a management problem?hashtag#Remote hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#Management hashtag#Training hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#CompetitiveAdvantage hashtag#EmployeeExperience hashtag#EmployeeRetention

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct. So the question is...Do you have a productivity problem or a management problem?hashtag#Remote hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#Management hashtag#Training hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#CompetitiveAdvantage hashtag#EmployeeExperience hashtag#EmployeeRetention

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Inlined (default for ERT (embedded real time) targets):--Embeds literal numeric values directly in code (means the numbers are hardcoded instead of being defined as variables or parameters. In Simulink (or programming in general), this means typing values like 5, 3.14, or [1 2 3] directly into block parameters)--Pros: Reduces RAM usage, improves execution speed.--Cons: Parameters are not tunable/calibratable post-code generation.--Required for: Models using Embedded Coder® with service interface configurations. (In Embedded Coder, a service interface configuration is a way to generate code that connects your Simulink model to external application software—like AUTOSAR components, real-time operating systems (RTOS), or custom embedded systems.)2.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

This is crucial for polymorphism in object-oriented programming and supports more maintainable, scalable, and extensible code. 🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Using dynamic method binding with overridden methods ✔ Understanding polymorphism through dynamic binding ✔ Structuring object relationships for flexibility and code reusabilityJain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

There is even temperature control software with a proportional-integral control algorithm to maintain a set-point temperature by adjusting the temperature of a heat circulator - entirely in MATLAB (MathWorks).You can find the description of our work here: https://lnkd.in/g9paZ-pPYou can access the software here: https://lnkd.in/gPr55-N8I developed this software at DTU Offshore - Danish Offshore Technology Centre with help from many colleagues, especially Rasoul Mokhtari and Karen Feilberg.

Inlined (default for ERT (embedded real time) targets):--Embeds literal numeric values directly in code (means the numbers are hardcoded instead of being defined as variables or parameters. In Simulink (or programming in general), this means typing values like 5, 3.14, or [1 2 3] directly into block parameters)--Pros: Reduces RAM usage, improves execution speed.--Cons: Parameters are not tunable/calibratable post-code generation.--Required for: Models using Embedded Coder® with service interface configurations. (In Embedded Coder, a service interface configuration is a way to generate code that connects your Simulink model to external application software—like AUTOSAR components, real-time operating systems (RTOS), or custom embedded systems.)2.

In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct. So the question is...Do you have a productivity problem or a management problem?hashtag#Remote hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#Management hashtag#Training hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#CompetitiveAdvantage hashtag#EmployeeExperience hashtag#EmployeeRetention

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

They gained more.⏱️Time management. 💪Autonomy. 🔎Focus 🏋️Flexibility. 📞Clarity in communication.And let’s not forget: most of them came from office environments in the first place.This bias isn’t about capability, it’s about outdated assumptions.Remote professionals aren’t the problem.

This is crucial for polymorphism in object-oriented programming and supports more maintainable, scalable, and extensible code. 🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Using dynamic method binding with overridden methods ✔ Understanding polymorphism through dynamic binding ✔ Structuring object relationships for flexibility and code reusabilityJain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Kùzu Inc.Kùzu Inc.,,"Happy Monday! In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

This is crucial for polymorphism in object-oriented programming and supports more maintainable, scalable, and extensible code. 🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Using dynamic method binding with overridden methods ✔ Understanding polymorphism through dynamic binding ✔ Structuring object relationships for flexibility and code reusabilityJain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Kùzu Inc.Kùzu Inc.,,"Happy Monday! In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

Abinaya CAbinaya C,,"Today's Learning Journey 📕: Stacks in JavaToday, I explored one of the fundamental data structures— the Stack.**What is a Stack?** A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

This is crucial for polymorphism in object-oriented programming and supports more maintainable, scalable, and extensible code. 🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Using dynamic method binding with overridden methods ✔ Understanding polymorphism through dynamic binding ✔ Structuring object relationships for flexibility and code reusabilityJain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Kùzu Inc.Kùzu Inc.,,"Happy Monday! In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

N TharunN Tharun,,"💻 Day 39: Dynamic Method Binding in Java 🧬 🔄 What You Explored: ✅ How method calls are resolved at runtime using dynamic (or late) binding ✅ The concept of overriding methods and how dynamic binding works with parent-child relationships ✅ Real-world example of dynamic method binding (e.g., invoking overridden methods with parent class references) 🔥 Why It Matters: Dynamic method binding enables flexibility in method invocation, allowing the program to call the most appropriate method based on the object type. This is crucial for polymorphism in object-oriented programming and supports more maintainable, scalable, and extensible code. 🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Using dynamic method binding with overridden methods ✔ Understanding polymorphism through dynamic binding ✔ Structuring object relationships for flexibility and code reusabilityJain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Kùzu Inc.Kùzu Inc.,,"Happy Monday! In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct.

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3.

Neha KulkarniNeha Kulkarni,,"🖥️Apparently working remotely means I forgot how to sit at a desk in an office.🪑Wild, right? 🤷🏽‍♀️Let’s talk about this weird little narrative that’s been floating around hiring circles:“Remote workers may not adjust well to in-office roles.”So just to recap: •Delivered results ✅ •Managed projects independently ✅ •Navigated global teams across time zones ✅ •Communicated clearly, met deadlines, stayed productive ✅But now suddenly, can’t function at a desk near coworkers?Remote workers didn’t lose their skills. They gained more.⏱️Time management. 💪Autonomy. 🔎Focus 🏋️Flexibility. 📞Clarity in communication.And let’s not forget: most of them came from office environments in the first place.This bias isn’t about capability, it’s about outdated assumptions.Remote professionals aren’t the problem. The double standard is.It’s time to stop treating remote experience like a liability and start recognizing it for what it is: a serious upgrade in how we work.hashtag#RemoteWork hashtag#Hiring hashtag#JobSearch hashtag#HybridWork hashtag#WorkplaceBias hashtag#OpenToWork hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Productivity hashtag#GlobalHiring hashtag#RemoteOpportunities hashtag#InOfficeWork hashtag#WorkFromAnywhere hashtag#RemoteCulture

This is crucial for polymorphism in object-oriented programming and supports more maintainable, scalable, and extensible code. 🏆 What You Practiced: ✔ Using dynamic method binding with overridden methods ✔ Understanding polymorphism through dynamic binding ✔ Structuring object relationships for flexibility and code reusabilityJain (Deemed-to-be University) Dr. Sanjeev Kumar Mandal, Ph.D, M.C.A, B.C.A Dr Sagar Gulati

Kùzu Inc.Kùzu Inc.,,"Happy Monday! In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate

Ashley WaddingtonAshley Waddington,,"Disclaimer: This post does not take a stance on in-office versus remote or hybrid work.It does however highlight that management cannot operate the same way in all settings.In my career, I have worked in both in-office and remote settings.I’ve had to have hard conversations in both settings.I’ve had to train people in both settings.I’ve had to build trust and rapport in both settings.Each setting has its own set of nuances. The key differentiator: how we communicate.Communication is key in people leadership no matter the setting, but remote management and team engagement require more intentional ways of communicating.Why? It’s easier to lean too heavily on contextless communication. This leaves room for more frequent misunderstandings and communication breakdowns.If the majority of your middle managers learned how to manage in-office but you want to keep the competitive advantage of offering remote or hybrid work, now is a great time to level up their training.Capturing the best talent moving forward will require more flexibility in where work gets done.Retaining that talent will lean heavily on their manager’s ability to foster the right environment for growth and workplace satisfaction.If you’re looking for support up-skilling your middle management team, let’s chat.When middle management is armed with the right skills employee productivity improves as a byproduct. So the question is...Do you have a productivity problem or a management problem?hashtag#Remote hashtag#Hybrid hashtag#Management hashtag#Training hashtag#FutureOfWork hashtag#CompetitiveAdvantage hashtag#EmployeeExperience hashtag#EmployeeRetention

Paul EzePaul Eze,,"HOW REMOTE WORK GIVES SMALL BUSINESSES A FIGHTING CHANCE In early 2020 as we contemplated or more like dreaded the idea of having the entire team working remotely, little did we know that remote work would be the silver lining we needed.Sure, we moved on from NGcareers in 2020 (after exiting to ROAM/Jobberman) but the lessons we got from working remotely in 2020 positioned us for our next venture.When we started Remote4Africa there was no question of whether to be a remote company or not. The very nature of Remote4Africa meant we had to live what we preached - full remote operation.SO HOW DOES WORKING REMOTELY FAVOUR THE SMALL GUY? As a small, medium or growing company remote work gives you several advantages. Forget the naysayers and come with me. The two biggest advantages;Bigger Talent Pool As a remote company you are not restricted to just one city in your search for talent to help grow the company. You can literally hire smart young people from across the entire country or even continent (We help companies hire remotely - https://lnkd.in/g5-2qm2p). Your talent pool becomes automatically wider. Greater Cost EfficiencyA startup or small business usually doesn’t have endless money, in fact most struggle financially in the early years until their products/services start to generate significant revenue to outpace expenses. So how do you keep yourself in the game and extend the chances of your business surviving? By keeping expenses as low as possible. Going remote does that for you. We spent millions annually in office rent in Lagos. That was money that could have gone into marketing or direct revenue impacting activity. If you are building/growing a business in any major African city you know office costs are a significant part of your expenses. Aside rent you are talking about utilities, furniture etc.You can take some of that saving and give your remote staff stuff like data allowances, workspace allowances etc to help them set up and work comfortably from home.If you run a company/business and thinking of going remote you can reach out and ask any questions. I’ll be glad to advise and share lessons from what we’ve learnt running a remote company for 5 years now.hashtag#hiringremote hashtag#remotecompanies hashtag#businesstips hashtag#recruitingtips

MANIKANTA Yaswanth kumarMANIKANTA Yaswanth kumar,,"Day:-8 Learning selenium with java (Automation)✅""Before diving into Selenium with Java, it's important to have a good understanding of Core Java topics.""🌟 What is Exception Handling?Exception handling is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running. Instead of stopping the entire program when an error happens, exception handling lets you control what should happen when something goes wrong.🌟 Why is it important?It helps prevent the program from crashing.It allows the program to continue running even after an error.It shows clear and friendly error messages to the user.It makes debugging and fixing issues easier.🌟 How does it work?You write the code that might cause an error inside a special block. If an error happens, another block will handle it. This keeps the program safe and avoids unexpected crashes.🌟 Key Terms:Try: The block where you write the code that might cause an error.Catch: The block where you handle the error if it occurs.Finally: A block that runs no matter what—whether there was an error or not.Throw: Used to create custom errors or exceptions.Throws: Used to declare exceptions that a method might cause.

The last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates — you add to the top and remove from the top.**Why It's Important?** Stacks are used in many areas like function calls, expression evaluation, undo features in editors, and more. Understanding how they work is essential for solving real-world problems and mastering algorithms.**Key Takeaways:** 1. Core Operations: push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty()2. Implementation: Explored Java's built-in Stack class and also implemented it manually using arrays and linked lists. 3. Applications: Helps build intuition for recursion, backtracking, and parsing tasks.hashtag#Java hashtag#DataStructures hashtag#Stack hashtag#CodingJourney hashtag#Programming hashtag#TechLearning

Inlined (default for ERT (embedded real time) targets):--Embeds literal numeric values directly in code (means the numbers are hardcoded instead of being defined as variables or parameters. In Simulink (or programming in general), this means typing values like 5, 3.14, or [1 2 3] directly into block parameters)--Pros: Reduces RAM usage, improves execution speed.--Cons: Parameters are not tunable/calibratable post-code generation.--Required for: Models using Embedded Coder® with service interface configurations. (In Embedded Coder, a service interface configuration is a way to generate code that connects your Simulink model to external application software—like AUTOSAR components, real-time operating systems (RTOS), or custom embedded systems.)2. Tunable (default for GRT (Generic real time) targets):--Stores parameters in a global structure (can be modified/calibrated post-generation).--Pros: Allows parameter tuning (e.g., for calibration).--Cons: Uses more RAM, slightly slower.hashtag#Simulink hashtag#EmbeddedCoder hashtag#ModelBasedDesign hashtag#CodeGeneration hashtag#MATLAB hashtag#EmbeddedSystems hashtag#ControlSystems hashtag#EngineeringTools hashtag#CCodeFromSimulink hashtag#TechDocumentation hashtag#electricvehicles

In the latest blog post by gdotv - Graph Database Client & Visualization Tooling, we can see an interesting Kuzu graph of past talks and events by Connected Data London, as part of the ""Connected Data Knowledge Graph Challenge"" (CDKG). As you'll see, the graph that's stored in a Kuzu database can be visualized effectively and effortlessly by G.V()! Blog post: https://lnkd.in/gmTZ-ZFEWhy Kuzu? The blog describes how Kuzu is built for speed, and how you can feel it when using it with G.V(). ""Queries finish running faster than you can blink. We’ve sampled quite a few datasets and tried path queries of up to 30 hops, all running at milliseconds scale.""✅ The CDKG graph has the following schema:  Speakers give talks, which have keyword tags (topic of the talk). Each talk is from a past event, and belongs to a particular category.✅ The power of graph visualization is clear with G.V(). The first image attached shows multiple layouts. The default mode is a ""force-directed"" layout, which shows clusters of speakers and talk topic keywords around a particular event.✅ The other image shows a tree layout, where it's immediately obvious, at a glance, which speakers spoke at both events, and which categories have the most talks. The different layouts each showcase different aspects about the data, making it a breeze to explore the data visually for insights.We think Kuzu and G.V() can help you discover many more insights on your own data!

Mohsen SadeghbeigiMohsen Sadeghbeigi,,"𝗔 𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗿-𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗝𝗮𝘃𝗮 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: 𝗛𝗶𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀Ever stumbled upon a Java feature that feels like a hidden superpower? Let me introduce you to Hidden Classes, a lesser-known capability added in Java 15 (JEP 371). These are dynamically generated classes that remain invisible to the outside world, meaning they’re not accessible via standard class loaders. Why Are They Cool?If you’ve worked with frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, or tools relying on dynamic proxies, you’ve likely encountered classes created on the fly. Hidden Classes take this to the next level by allowing frameworks to generate classes at runtime that are:Secure: They can’t be accessed directly outside their defining context.Efficient: They reduce memory overhead by avoiding unnecessary class loading.Clean: They keep the JVM’s namespace tidy by staying hidden.This makes them perfect for:Dynamic Proxy Generation (e.g., Spring AOP or mock libraries like Mockito).ORM Frameworks (e.g., Hibernate generating proxies for lazy-loaded entities).Reflection-based Tools (e.g., libraries creating helper classes at runtime).Fun fact: Hibernate has been leveraging Hidden Classes in newer versions to optimize proxy generation, reducing memory footprint for large-scale apps!Why Are They Cool?Hidden Classes shine in performance and security. By keeping dynamically generated classes out of the standard class loader, they prevent accidental (or malicious) access. Plus, they’re lightweight, which is a win for applications generating thousands of proxies, like a busy Spring Boot app handling millions of requests.There’s a catch, though: Hidden Classes are tied to a single JVM instance. You can’t serialize or persist them, so they’re best for transient, runtime-only tasks.As an example:We use defineHiddenClass (introduced in Java 15) to create a class that’s hidden from standard class loaders. In real projects, you’d generate bytecode with libraries like ASM or ByteBuddy, which are popular for creating dynamic classes (e.g., Hibernate uses similar techniques for entity proxies).hashtag#Java hashtag#HiddenClasses hashtag#JVM hashtag#Reflection hashtag#Spring hashtag#Hibernate
